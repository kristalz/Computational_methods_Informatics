A recent study demonstrated that systemic treatment with gintonin enhances paracellular permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through the LPA1/3 receptor. However, little is known about whether gintonin can enhance brain delivery of donepezil (DPZ) (Aricept), which is a representative cognition-improving drug used in AD clinics. In the present study, we examined whether systemic administration of gintonin can stimulate brain delivery of DPZ.We administered gintonin and DPZ alone or coadministered gintonin with DPZ intravenously or orally to rats. Then we collected the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and serum and determined the DPZ concentration through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.Intravenous, but not oral, coadministration of gintonin with DPZ increased the CSF concentration of DPZ in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.

The aim of this article is to develop a Bayesian scalar-on-image regression model to integrate high-dimensional imaging data and clinical data to predict cognitive, behavioral, or emotional outcomes, while allowing for nonignorable missing outcomes. Such a nonignorable nonresponse consideration is motivated by examining the association between baseline characteristics and cognitive abilities for 802 Alzheimer patients enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI1), for which data are partially missing. Ignoring such missing data may distort the accuracy of statistical inference and provoke misleading results. To address this issue, we propose an imaging exponential tilting model to delineate the data missing mechanism and incorporate an instrumental variable to facilitate model identifiability followed by a Bayesian framework with Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to conduct statistical inference. This approach is validated in simulation studies where both the finite sample performance and asymptotic properties are evaluated and compared with the model with fully observed data and that with a misspecified ignorable missing mechanism. Our proposed methods are finally carried out on the ADNI1 dataset, which turns out to capture both of those clinical risk factors and imaging regions consistent with the existing literature that exhibits clinical significance.

They are made up of protofilaments composed of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides that are held together with extraordinary stability by a network of tight steric zippers and axial hydrogen bonds. This review explores the hypothesis that the peptide conformation within a protofilament represents the physical embodiment of a \"strain\" of AD. Evidence suggests that within a single strain the fold of individual peptides is invariant. However, the fibrils are capable of structural polymorphism that includes variation in the arrangement of protofilaments into fibrils, the pitch of the resultant fibrils, and the higher-order organization of the plaques into which they aggregate. These intrastrain polymorphisms are separated by low energy barriers, allowing multiple configurations to coexist within a single preparation or tissue. Clinical presentation of different strains may be determined by variation in the way different protofilament structures generate the relevant toxic species, be they monomers, oligomers, or higher-order structures. Evidence reviewed here is consistent with a model in which disease progression is concomitant with a gradual, progressive annealing of amyloid fibrils from benign, loosely packed structures into dense neurotoxic aggregates. This model challenges the commonly held hypothesis that oligomers of A\u03b2 peptides are the only active proximate species in neurodegeneration. However, the data do not implicate fibrils themselves. Rather, they cast suspicion on larger-scale supramolecular aggregates as toxic agents. Electron tomography of amyloid plaques in situ strongly suggests that the formation of amyloid aggregates results in perturbation of the cellular membrane integrity, warranting further investigation of this as a potential mode of neurotoxicity. If dense supramolecular amyloid aggregates prove to be important agents of neurodegeneration in AD, this model may also have relevance to other forms of amyloidoses.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloidosis", "Humans", "Plaque, Amyloid"]}, "33323224": {"ArticleTitle": "Healthy ageing through internet counselling in the elderly (HATICE): a multinational, randomised controlled trial.", "AbstractText": "Although web-based interventions have been promoted for cardiovascular risk management over the past decade, there is limited evidence for effectiveness of these interventions in people older than 65 years.

Our extended model results show that the first two hypotheses do not account for the observed correlation. Consistent with the third hypothesis, the interaction between age and the AD PGS accounts for the correlation between genetic traits and asset holdings.

Microglia generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a promising in vitro cellular model for studying the neuroimmune interactions involved in these disorders. Among several methods of generating -hiPSC-derived microglia (iMG) - varying in duration and resultant purity - a recent protocol by Brownjohn et al. [Stem Cell Reports. 2018 Apr;10(4):1294-307] is particularly simple and efficient. However, the replicability of this method, transcriptomic similarity of these iMG to primary adult microglia, and their genetic relevance to disease (i.e., enrichment of disease risk loci in genes preferentially expressed in these cells) remains unclear. Using two hiPSC lines, we demonstrated that Brownjohn's protocol can rapidly generate iMG that morphologically and functionally resembled microglia. The iMG cells we generated were found to be transcriptionally similar to previously reported iMG, as well as fetal and adult microglia. Furthermore, by using cell type-specific gene expression to partition disease heritability, we showed that iMG cells are genetically relevant to AD but found no significant enrichments of risk loci of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, or body mass index. Across a range of neuronal and immune cell types, we found only iMG, primary microglia, and microglia-like cell types exhibited a significant enrichment for AD heritability. Our results thus support the use of iMG as a human cellular model for understanding AD biology and underlying genetic factors, as well as for developing and efficiently screening new therapeutics.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": []}, "32375155": {"ArticleTitle": "A Pilot Study of Urinary Exosomes in Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by most cell types and abundantly present in body fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and breast milk.

"AbstractText": "In recent years the theme of the relationship of Alzheimers disease (AD) and metabolic disorders has been widely discussed. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether AD is a direct cause of carbohydrate metabolism disorders or it is the presence of classical risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2), primarily obesity, that significantly increases the risk of AD.To evaluate the separate contribution of two factors to the development of disorders of carbohydrate metabolism: (1) weight gain due to a high-calorie diet and (2) experimental-induced AD.Male Wistar rats were injected with streptozocin (STZ) in the lateral ventricles of the brain to induce AD or saline (sham operated animals - SO) during stereotactic operations. After 2 weeks, the animals were divided into four groups: 1) the SO group, which was assigned to the normal calorie (NCD) diet (SO NCD); 2) the SO group, which was assigned to the high-calorie diet (SO HCD); 3) the group to which the norm-calorie diet was prescribed after the administration of STZ into the lateral ventricles of the brain (STZ NCD); 4) the group to which the HCD was assigned after the administration of STZ (STZ HCD). The animals were on a diet for 3 months. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were carried out before the diet and after 3 months. At the end of the study, a morphological assessment of brain tissue, pancreas, and liver was performed.3 months after surgical interventions and the appointment of diets, the glycemic curves significantly differed in the 4 studied groups: normoglycemia persisted only in the SO + NCD group, while HCD and the STZ administration were accompanied by the development of hyperglycemia (p = 0.0001). The STZ + N\u0421D group, which represented the isolated effect of AD, was also characterized by impaired carbohydrate metabolism. A morphological study showed that HCD leads to a more pronounced ectopic accumulation of fat in the liver and pancreas tissue than NCD. The administration of STZ, regardless of the diet, led to changes typical for the AD model an increase in the size of the ventricles of the brain, degeneration of white matter, and the accumulation of -amyloid in the hypothalamus.The STZ-induced brain damage typical for AD led to impaired carbohydrate metabolism regardless of diet and was an independent risk factor for hyperglycemia.\u041e\u0431\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0412 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044b

Following primary replication in mucosal epithelial cells, the virus can enter sensory neurons innervating peripheral tissues via nerve termini. The viral genome is then transported to the nucleus where it can be maintained without producing infectious progeny, and thus latency is established in the cell. Yin-Yang balance is an essential concept in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory. Yin represents stable and inhibitory factors, and Yang represents the active and aggressive factors. When the organism is exposed to stress, especially psychological stress caused by emotional stimulation, the Yin-Yang balance is disturbed and the virus can re-engage in productive replication, resulting in recurrent diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the stress-induced susceptibility to HSV-1 primary infection and reactivation is needed and will provide helpful insights into the effective control and treatment of HSV-1.

Methods: Database searching was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Medline. This study was designed following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria. Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) software was adopted to perform meta-analysis evaluating the standard mean difference (SMD) with its 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 5,286 participants were enrolled from 27 case-control studies in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that total cholesterol (TC) level was significantly associated with AD in late-life (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: [0.01, 0.32], P = 0.03), especially in the subgroup under 70 years old (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.79], P = 0.01) and the subgroup of Western population (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: [0.04, 0.53], P = 0.02). In the subgroup under 70 years old, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (SMD = -0.50, 95% CI: [-0.76, -0.25], P = 0.0001) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: [0.02, 1.16], P = 0.04) in the AD group were significantly lower and higher than in the control group, respectively. In the subgroup with a sample size larger than 100 subjects, the LDL-C level was significantly higher in AD patients than in the control elderly group (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.56], P = 0.02). There was no significant association between triglyceride (TG) levels and AD in later-life (SMD = -0.00, 95% CI: [-0.12, 0.12], P = 1.00). Conclusion: TC can be a new predictive biomarker of AD or cognitive decline in later-life. Increased TC levels are found to be associated with an elevated risk of AD.

We use cosine similarity and sub-network kernels to measure attribute similarity and structure similarity, respectively. By integrating the structure similarity and attribute similarity into one matrix, spectral clustering is used to achieve brain network clustering. Finally, we evaluate this method on three diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Bipolar disorder patients, and Schizophrenia. The performance of methods is evaluated by measuring clustering consistency. Clustering consistency is similar to clustering accuracy, which is used to evaluate the consistency between the clustering labels and clinical diagnostic labels of the subjects.

Nonetheless, the specific mechanisms underlying each of these steps remains uncertain and is a fertile ground for new experimental approaches potentially requiring new experimental models.

The brunt of the changes seen during neurofibrillary stages (NFT) I-VI is borne by top-down projection neurons that contribute to cortico-cortical connectivities between different neocortical fields.

Neurofibrillary pathology in these regions is routinely associated with late NFT stages. Sequential changes occur in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) of these early-involved neurons. Tau pathology first develops in distal segments of basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected pyramidal neurons.

Positive and synergistic associations between the different types of protein deposits have been reported, leading to worse prognosis and cognitive decline. A large variation in phenotypic clinical presentation of these diseases, largely due to the frequent presence of co-pathologies, makes differential diagnosis challenging.

Tau aggregation in the different Tauopathies differs in the affected cell type, the structure of aggregates and Tau isoform composition. However, in all Tauopathies, accumulation of pathological Tau in well-characterized and well-defined brain regions, correlates strongly with symptoms associated with the dysfunction of this brain region. Hence, symptoms of neurodegenerative Tauopathies can range from motoric to cognitive and behavioral symptoms, even extending to deterioration of vital functions when the disease progresses, or combinations of different symptoms governed by the affected brain regions. The most common Tauopathies are corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementias with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). However a growing number of diseases are characterized by Tau aggregation amounting to a large family of more than 20 disorders [176]. Most Tauopathies are sporadic, and are hence linked to a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. However, mutations in MAPT have been identified which are autosomal dominantly linked to Tauopathies, including FTDP, PSP and CBD [94, 163, 185] (Alzforum, https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/mapt ). More than 80 mutations have been identified in MAPT, both in intronic and exonic regions of the human MAPT. These mutations can be classified as missense mutations or splicing mutations. Most missense mutations cluster in or near the microtubule binding site of Tau, while most splicing mutations affect the splicing of exon 10 (encoding the R2 domain), and hence affect the 3R/4R ratio. While Alzheimer's disease (AD), is the most prevalent Tauopathy, no mutations in MAPT associated with AD have been identified. Brains of AD patients are pathologically characterized by the combined presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [171]. Familial forms of AD, termed early onset familial AD (EOFAD) with clinical mutations in APP or PS1/2, have an early onset, and are invariably characterized by the combined presence of amyloid and Tau pathology [24, 80, 170]. These EOFAD cases, identify a causal link between APP/PS1 misprocessing and the development of Tau pathology and neurodegeneration [80, 170]. Furthermore, combined genetic, pathological, biomarker and in vivo modelling data, indicate that amyloid pathology precedes Tau pathology, and support a role for A\u03b2 as initiator and Tau as executor in the pathogenetic process of AD [80, 96, 97]. Hence, AD is often considered as a secondary Tauopathy (similar as for Down syndrome patients), in contrast to the primary Tauopathies described above. Tau aggregates in Tauopathies vary with respect to the ratio of different Tau isoforms (3R/4R), to the cell types displaying Tau aggregation and the structure of the aggregates.

Tauopathy induces loss of synapses, which is one of the earliest structural correlates of cognitive dysfunction and disease progression.

Signs of fast axonal transport disruption are pervasive in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies and various mechanisms have been proposed for regulation of fast axonal transport by tau. Post-translational modifications of tau including phosphorylation at specific sites, FTDP-17 point mutations, and oligomerization, confer upon tau a toxic effect on fast axonal transport. Consistent with the well-established dependence of axons on fast axonal transport, these disease-related modifications are closely associated temporally and spatially with axonal degeneration in the early disease stages.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as promising candidates in nanomedicine have great potentials in developing novel entities for central nervous system pathologies, due to their excellent physicochemical properties and ability to interface with neurons and neuronal circuits. However, most of the studies mainly focused on the drug delivery and bioimaging applications of CNTs, while neglect their application prospects as therapeutic drugs themselves. At present, the relevant reviews are not available yet.

AD considered as an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with progressive memory impairment moreover cognitive functions, while MCI would be considered as a transitional phase amongst age-related cognitive weakening. Numerous machine learning approaches have been examined, aiming at AD computer-aided diagnosis through employing MR image analysis. Conversely, MR brain image changes could be caused by different effects such as aging and dementia. It is still a challenging difficulty to extract the relevant imaging features and classify the subjects of different groups. This paper would propose an automatic classification technique based on feature decomposition and kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) for classifications of progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. normal control (NC), AD vs. NC, and pMCI vs. stable MCI (sMCI). Feature decomposition would be based on dictionary learning, which is used for separation of class-specific components from the non-class-specific components in the features, while KDA would be applied for mapping original nonlinearly separable feature space to the separable features that are linear. The proposed technique would be evaluated by employing T1-weighted MR brain images from 830 subjects comprising 198 AD patients, 167 pMCI, 236 sMCI, and 229 NC from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that classification accuracy (ACC) of 90.41%, 84.29%, and 65.94% can be achieved for classification of AD vs. NC, pMCI vs. NC, and pMCI vs. sMCI, respectively, indicating the promising performance of the proposed method.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Aged", "Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Databases, Factual", "Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted", "Discriminant Analysis", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Linear Models", "Machine Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Reproducibility of Results"]}, "32072882": {"ArticleTitle": "Challenges in the Discovery of Novel Therapeutic Agents in Cancer.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Drug Discovery", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Phytochemicals"]}, "32065917": {"ArticleTitle": "Neurophysiological alterations in the nucleus reuniens of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "Recently, increased neuronal activity in nucleus reuniens (Re) has been linked to hyperexcitability within hippocampal-thalamo-cortical networks in the J20 mouse model of amyloidopathy.

A greater proportion of Re neurons display hyperpolarized membrane potentials in J20 mice without changes to the incidence or frequency of spontaneous action potentials. Re neurons recorded from J20 mice did not exhibit increased action potential generation in response to depolarizing current stimuli but an increased propensity to rebound burst following hyperpolarizing current stimuli. Increased rebound firing did not appear to result from alterations to T-type Ca2+ channels. Finally, in J20 mice, there was an ~8% reduction in spike width, similar to what has been reported in CA1 pyramidal neurons from multiple amyloidopathy mice.

However, little multi-omics data is available for AD, due to limited availability of brain tissues. Even if omics data exist, systematic drug repurposing study for AD has suffered from lack of big data, insufficient clinical information, and difficulty in data integration on account of sample heterogeneity derived from poor diagnosis or shortage of qualified post-mortem tissue. In this study, we developed a proteotranscriptomic-based computational drug repositioning method named Drug Repositioning Perturbation Score/Class (DRPS/C) based on inverse associations between disease- and drug-induced gene and protein perturbation patterns, incorporating pharmacogenomic knowledge. We constructed a Drug-induced Gene Perturbation Signature Database (DGPSD) comprised of 61,019 gene signatures perturbed by 1,520 drugs from the Connectivity Map (CMap) and the L1000 CMap. Drugs were classified into three DRPCs (High, Intermediate, and Low) according to DRPSs that were calculated using drug- and disease-induced gene perturbation signatures from DGPSD and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively. The DRPS/C method was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve, with a prescribed drug list from TCGA as the gold standard. Glioblastoma had the highest AUC. To predict anti-AD drugs, DRPS were calculated using DGPSD and AD-induced gene/protein perturbation signatures generated from RNA-seq, microarray and proteomic datasets in the Synapse database, and the drugs were classified into DRPCs.

It is believed to contribute additively to the cognitive impairment and to lower the threshold for the development of dementia. However, accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction of the cerebral vasculature and AD neuropathology interact in multiple ways. Vascular processes even proceed AD neuropathology, implicating a causal role in the etiology of AD. Thus, the review aims to provide an integrated view on vascular dysfunction in AD.In AD, the cerebral vasculature undergoes pronounced cellular, morphological and structural changes, which alters regulation of blood flow, vascular fluid dynamics and vessel integrity. Stiffening of central blood vessels lead to transmission of excessive pulsatile energy to the brain microvasculature, causing end-organ damage. Moreover, a dysregulated hemostasis and chronic vascular inflammation further impede vascular function, where its mediators interact synergistically. Changes of the cerebral vasculature are triggered and driven by systemic vascular abnormalities that are part of aging, and which can be accelerated and aggravated by cardiovascular diseases. Key Messages: In AD, the cerebral vasculature is the locus where multiple pathogenic processes converge and contribute to cognitive impairment.

While animal models have been valuable in elucidating disease mechanisms and in providing insights into the function of specific genes, the predictive validity of preclinical models to test potential therapies has been questioned. In the last two decades, diverse new murine models of Down syndrome (DS) have been developed and numerous studies have demonstrated neurobiological alterations that could be responsible for the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes found in this syndrome. In many cases, similar alterations were found in murine models and in individuals with DS, although several phenotypes shown in animals have yet not been confirmed in the human condition. Some of the neurobiological alterations observed in mice have been proposed to account for their changes in cognition and behavior, and have received special attention because of being putative therapeutic targets. Those include increased oxidative stress, altered neurogenesis, overexpression of the Dyrk1A gene, GABA-mediated overinhibition and Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration. Subsequently, different laboratories have tested the efficacy of pharmacotherapies targeting these alterations. Unfortunately, animal models are limited in their ability to mimic the extremely complex process of human neurodevelopment and neuropathology. Therefore, the safety and efficacy identified in animal studies are not always translated to humans, and most of the drugs tested have not demonstrated any positive effect or very limited efficacy in clinical trials. Despite their limitations, though, animal trials give us extremely valuable information for developing and testing drugs for human use that cannot be obtained from molecular or cellular experiments alone. This chapter reviews some of these therapeutic approaches and discusses some reasons that could account for the discrepancy between the findings in mouse models of DS and in humans, including: (i) the incomplete resemble of the genetic alterations of available mouse models of DS and human trisomy 21, (ii) the lack of evidence that some of the phenotypic alterations found in mice (e.g., GABA-mediated overinhibition, and alterations in adult neurogenesis) are also present in DS individuals, and (iii) the inaccuracy and/or inadequacy of the methods used in clinical trials to detect changes in the cognitive and behavioral functions of people with DS. Despite the shortcomings of animal models, animal experimentation remains an invaluable tool in developing drugs.

In DS context, several lines of evidence and emerging hypotheses suggest that other molecular players and pathways may be implicated in these complex phenotypes. In this review, we outline the normal functioning of endosomal trafficking and summarize the research on endo-lysosomal dysfunction in DS in light of AD findings. We emphasize the role of genes of chromosome 21 implicated in endocytosis to explain endosomal abnormalities and set the limitations and perspectives of models used to explore endo-lysosomal dysfunction in DS and find new biomarkers.

Models of the extracellular domain of TREM2 show that Nasu-Hakola disease-associated mutations are grossly inactivating by truncation, frameshift, or unfolding, that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated variants localize to a putative ligand-interacting region (PLIR) on the extracellular surface, and that FTD-associated variants are found in the hydrophobic core.

A number of studies on the benefits of AGE against cognitive and memory deficits have also been published. This review aimed to summarize the information related to the effects of AGE on learning memory in order to obtain a better understanding of its mechanisms of action. This review also presents an overview of the pathogenesis of AD, and summarizes the main ingredients and neuroprotective effects of AGE against cognitive and learning memory deficits.

The most important feature of AD is the gradual irreversible loss of cognitive ability through the formation of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau protein. The metabolism of A\u03b2 and tau proteins is closely related to and is affected by autophagy. Current research speculates that autophagy dysfunction leads to an increase in harmful proteins in AD. \u03b2-Asarone is the main constituent of Acorus tatarinowii Schott and has important effects on the central nervous system. In this paper, we primarily explored the effects of \u03b2-asarone on the clearance of noxious proteins and the associated potential mechanisms via autophagy in a PC12 cell AD model. A CCK-8 assay and LDH experiments were used to assess cell viability/toxicity, and SPiDER-\u03b2Gal was used to detect cellular senescence. The important proteins associated with the pathogenesis of AD including APP, PS1, A\u03b2, BACE1, and SYN1 were analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot analysis. Antimycin A (A3) and cyclosporine A (CSA) were selected as the activators and inhibitors of autophagy, respectively. LC3, BECN, P62, PINK1, and Parkin protein expression were also examined by IF and Western blot analysis. The data showed that \u03b2-asarone administration significantly dose-dependently increased cell proliferation and decreased cytotoxicity; moreover, \u03b2-asarone inhibited SA-\u03b2Gal and improved cell senescence. The results further showed that, compared to the model, APP, PS1, A\u03b2, BACE1, and p62 were reduced, while SYN1, BECN1, and LC3 were increased after treatment with \u03b2-asarone. The results of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) showed a highly significant relationship between the pathological factors of AD and the protein expression of autophagy. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that \u03b2-asarone can inhibit A\u03b2, and this effect may occur by promoting autophagy in a cell model of AD.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": []}, "32009890": {"ArticleTitle": "Kaixinsan, a Well-Known Chinese Herbal Prescription, for Alzheimer's Disease and Depression: A Preclinical Systematic Review.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is highly prevalent worldwide with no modifying therapy. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in most patients with AD, and depression is one of the most common AD-related BPSD. Kaixinsan (KXS) is an ancient Chinese herbal prescription widely used to treat dementia and forgetfulness. In this systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess preclinical evidence for the effects of KXS on cognitive impairment and depression. Thirty-eight articles involving 1,050 animals were included after searching from six databases from the inception up to June 2019. The primary outcome measures were behavioral outcome. Indicators of cognitive function in AD included escape latency, time spent on the target quadrant, and the number of target platform crossings in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Indicators of depression included number of rearing events and total distance in the open-field test, duration of immobility in the forced swim test, and sucrose consumption or sucrose preference index in the sucrose preference test. The secondary outcomes were mechanisms of KXS for treatment of AD and depression. The results showed that KXS significantly reduced escape latency (P < 0.01), increased time spent in the target quadrant (P < 0.01), and increased the number of target platform crossings (P < 0.01) in the MWM test in AD models compared with control. The possible mechanisms for KXS-mediated improvements in cognitive function were antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, antiapoptotic activity, neuroprotection, and synapse protection. In addition, the results demonstrated that KXS significantly increased the number of rearing instances (P < 0.01) in the open-field test, decreased the duration of immobility (P < 0.01) in forced swim test, and increased sucrose consumption or sucrose preference index (P < 0.01) in the sucrose preference test in depression models compared with control. The mechanisms of KXS-mediated anti-depressive effects were HPA axis regulation, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, synapse protection, and neuroprotection.

The volume of the hippocampus is an authentic imaging biomarker for AD.

We examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) were associated with cardiometabolic health indicators through childhood and adolescence. Methods: In 7,977 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we tested whether a PRS for Alzheimer's disease was associated with trajectories of cardiometabolic risk factors. We examined trajectories for height at 1-18 years; lean and fat mass at 9-18 years; systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 7-18 years; glucose and C-reactive protein at 9-18 years; insulin at 10-18 years; and high and low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides birth at 18 years. We also examined birthweight and interleukin-6 (IL-6) at age 9 years and physical activity at ages 11, 12, and 15 years. Results: No consistent associations were observed between the PRS excluding genetic variants in the apolipoprotein E gene region and cardiometabolic factors trajectories across childhood and adolescence.

Tau protein binds to microtubules and is best known for its role in regulating microtubule dynamics. However, if tau protein is phosphorylated by activated major tau kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 or cyclin-dependent kinase 5, or inactivated tau phosphatase, including protein phosphatase 2A, its affinity for microtubules is reduced, and the free tau is believed to aggregate, thereby forming neurofibrillary tangles. We previously reported that pitavastatin decreases the total and phosphorylated tau protein using a cellular model of tauopathy. The reduction of tau was considered to be due to Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition by pitavastatin. ROCK plays important roles to organize the actin cytoskeleton, an expected therapeutic target of human disorders. Several ROCK inhibitors are clinically applied to prevent vasospasm postsubarachnoid hemorrhage (fasudil) and for the treatment of glaucoma (ripasudil). We have examined the effects of ROCK inhibitors (H1152, Y-27632, and fasudil [HA-1077]) on tau protein phosphorylation in detail. A human neuroblastoma cell line (M1C\u00a0cells) that expresses wild-type tau protein (4R0N) by tetracycline-off (TetOff) induction, primary cultured mouse neurons, and a mouse model of tauopathy (rTG4510 line) were used. The levels of phosphorylated tau and caspase-cleaved tau were reduced by the ROCK inhibitors. Oligomeric tau levels were also reduced by ROCK inhibitors. After ROCK inhibitor treatment, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and caspase were inactivated, protein phosphatase 2A was activated, and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 were reduced. ROCK inhibitors activated autophagy and proteasome pathways, which are considered important for the degradation of tau protein. Collectively, these results suggest that ROCK inhibitors represent a viable therapeutic route to reduce the pathogenic forms of tau protein in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Humans", "Mice", "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "Phosphorylation", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "Proteolysis", "Quinolines", "Signal Transduction", "Tauopathies", "rho-Associated Kinases", "tau Proteins"]}, "31980280": {"ArticleTitle": "Cerebrospinal fluid progranulin is associated with increased cortical thickness in early stages of Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "Progranulin plays an important role in neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, being upregulated by activated microglia.

A series of biochemical assays was used to investigate the associated regulatory signaling networks.

Graph theoretical modelling is being significantly used in studying the topology of the brain networks. The results show the disruption of connectivity in motor regions in later stages of AD in addition to memory regions and conversely in PD the memory regions were found to have disrupted connectivity in addition to the motor regions. Further, the Z scores of intra and inter hemispheric regions in AD and PD also indicate the disruption in connectivity as the disease progresses.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neurodegenerative Diseases"]}, "31945936": {"ArticleTitle": "Classification of Alzheimer's Disease in MRI based on Dictionary Learning and Heavy Tailed Modelling.", "AbstractText": "Diagnosis of brain diseases is considered one of the most challenging medical tasks to perform, even for medical experts who rely on high-resolution anatomical images to identify signs of abnormalities by visual inspection.

As the cognitive scores can effectively indicate the disease status, the prediction of the scores using the longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a joint learning and clinical scores prediction method for AD diagnosis via longitudinal MRI data. Specifically, we devise a novel feature selection method that consists of a temporally constrained group LASSO model and the correntropy. The baseline MRI data is used to jointly select the most discriminative features. Then, we use the stacked long short-term memory (SLSTM) to effectively capture useful information in the input sequence to predict the clinical scores of future time points.

The construction of brain networks based on brain image data to depict the interaction of brain functions or structures at the level of brain connections has been widely used to identify individuals with MCI/AD from the normal control (NC). Exploring the structural and functional connections and interactions between brain regions is beneficial to detect MCI. For this reason, we propose a new model for automatic MCI diagnosis based on this information. Firstly, a new functional brain network estimation method is proposed. Self-calibration is introduced using quality indicators, and functional brain network estimation is performed at the same time. Then we integrate the functional and structural connected neuroimaging patterns into our multitask learning model to select informative feature. By identifying synergies and differences between different tasks, the most discriminative features are determined. Finally, the most relevant features are sent to the support vector machine classifier for diagnosis and identification of MCI.

Unfortunately, current therapeutics are limited only to symptomatic relief and do not halt the progression of neurodegeneration. Previous in vitro experiments have shown that a water-soluble formulation of coenzyme-Q10, Ubisol-Q10, can stabilize the mitochondria, prevent oxidative stress, and inhibit premature senescence in fibroblasts of AD patients. Since autophagy plays a critical role in maintenance and survival of neurons, we hypothesized that Ubisol-Q10 treatment could result in resumption of autophagy.

We found increased expression of autophagy-related genes beclin-1 and JNK1 following Ubisol-Q10 treatment of AD fibroblasts. These results were confirmed at the protein level by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Interestingly, despite reduction of oxidative stress in cells due to Ubisol-Q10 treatment, autophagy inhibition leads to resumption of premature senescence in these PS-1 mutated fibroblasts indicating that autophagy is critical to prevent the senescence phenotype. Withdrawal of Ubisol-Q10 treatment also leads to the return of the senescence phenotype in AD fibroblasts indicating that constant supplementation of Ubisol-Q10 is required. Additionally, Ubisol-Q10 supplementation in the drinking water of double transgenic AD mice leads to increased expression of beclin-1 and JNK1 in the cortical region.

Second, most existing methods often make prediction based on a single classifier, which might not be able to address the heterogeneity of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Third, many existing methods often employ feature selection (or reduction) and classifier training in two independent steps, without considering the fact that the two pipelined steps are highly related to each other.

Ferritin is a 24 subunit spherical shell protein composed of both light (FTL) and heavy chain (FTH1) subunits, possessing complimentary iron-handling functions and forming three-fold and four-fold pores. Iron uptake through the three-fold pores is well-defined, but the unloading process somewhat less and generally focuses on lysosomal ferritin degradation although it may have an additional, energetically efficient pore mechanism. Hereditary Ferritinopathy (HF) or neuroferritinopathy is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the FTL C-terminal sequence, which in turn cause disorder and unraveling at the four-fold pores allowing iron leakage and enhanced formation of toxic, improperly coordinated iron (ICI). Histopathologically, HF is characterized by iron deposition and formation of ferritin inclusion bodies (IBs) as the cells overexpress ferritin in an attempt to address iron accumulation while lacking the ability to clear ferritin and its aggregates. Overexpression and IB formation tax cells materially and energetically, i.e., their synthesis and disposal systems, and may hinder cellular transport and other spatially dependent functions. ICI causes cellular damage to proteins and lipids through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation because of high levels of brain oxygen, reductants and metabolism, taxing cellular repair. Iron can cause protein aggregation both indirectly by ROS-induced protein modification and destabilization, and directly as with mutant ferritin through C-terminal bridging. Iron release and ferritin degradation are also linked to cellular misfunction through ferritinophagy, which can release sufficient iron to initiate the unique programmed cell death process ferroptosis causing ROS formation and lipid peroxidation. But IB buildup suggests suppressed ferritinophagy, with elevated iron from four-fold pore leakage together with ROS damage and stress leading to a long-term ferroptotic-like state in HF. Several of these processes have parallels in cell line and mouse models.

Cognitive impairment and dementia have traditionally been stratified into subtypes of varying origin, e.g., vascular dementia versus dementia of the Alzheimer's type (Alzheimer's disease; AD).

Mitochondrial dysfunctions play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, due to disturbances in the bioenergetic properties of cells. To date, the usual therapeutic drugs are limited because of the diversity of cellular routes in AD and the toxic potential of these agents.

In addition, the antioxidant capacity of \u03b1-LA is associated with two thiol groups that can be oxidised or reduced, prevent excess free radical formation, and act on improvement of mitochondrial performance.

In addition, H6R diminished and D7H enhanced the modulating effect of heparin. The difference in the heparin-dependent modulation was associated with coordination of zinc ions within the MBDs of the mutant peptides. The findings indicate that anion-binding sites formed by complexes of zinc ions with the A\u03b2 MBD play an essential role in the interaction of zinc-induced A\u03b2 aggregates with heparin.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Heparin", "Humans", "Mutation", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Zinc"]}, "31876280": {"ArticleTitle": "[The Convergence of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis Concepts].", "AbstractText": "Advances in the research of molecular factors involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, have led to the creation of several pathogenesis concepts of the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world, and amyloid, cholinergic, and neuroinflammatory hypotheses became leading.

Among these, 75% were aware of the association between periodontitis (PD) and diabetes, and 53% to 59% were aware of the impact of PD on cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, and respiratory infections. Few GPs identified PD as a possible risk factor of rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer disease (35.18% and <15%, respectively); 74.31% of GPs reported never asking their patients about their periodontal health.

On the other hand, among older individuals with WM cognitive stability, differences in baseline performance might determine dissimilar fMRI trajectories. In this vein, the findings in the SHP subgroup support the brain maintenance hypothesis, suggesting that stable and high WM performance in aging is sustained by functional efficiency and maintained brain structure rather than compensatory changes.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Aged", "Aging", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Organ Size"]}, "31873787": {"ArticleTitle": "Disease-specific profiles of apathy in Alzheimer's disease and behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia differ across the disease course.", "AbstractText": "Apathy is one of the most prevalent and disabling non-cognitive symptoms of dementia.

Here, we employed a cross-sectional design to characterise the multidimensional nature of apathy across syndromes and disease course. 92 participants (44 bvFTD, 20 AD, 28 controls) completed the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) to quantify emotional, executive, and initiation apathy. Patients were divided into early and late stages based on time since symptom onset. All participants underwent structural MRI and voxel-based morphometry was used to identify neural correlates of apathy dimensions. In the early stage of the disease (<\u20095\u00a0years since onset), emotional apathy was greater in bvFTD than AD. In contrast, in the late stage (>\u20095\u00a0years since onset), executive apathy was greater in AD than bvFTD, although apathy was elevated across all dimensions compared to controls. Notably, apathy was observed in the absence of self-reported depression in 46.2% of patients, with no patients classified as depressed only.

Multiple factors involving neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-\u03b2 plaques lead to the progression of the AD, generated by aggregated hyperphosphorylated Tau protein.

It has been therefore suggested that the multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis requires the design of antioxidant drugs with a broad spectrum of neuroprotective activities. For this reason, the use of natural products, characterized by multiple pharmacological properties is advantageous as AD-modifying drugs over the single-targeted chemicals. Artemether, a peroxide sesquiterpenoid lipid-soluble compound, has been used in the clinic as an antimalarial drug. Also, it exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.

In 3xTg-AD mice, Artemether attenuated learning and memory deficits, inhibited cortical neuronal apoptosis and glial activation, inhibited oxidative stress through decrease of lipid peroxidation and increased expression of SOD, and reduced A\u03b2 deposition and tau protein phosphorylation. Moreover, in 3xTg-AD mice, Artemether induced phosphorylation of the AMPK/GSK3\u03b2 pathway which activated Nrf2, increasing the level of antioxidant protein HO-1.

Cannabis plant has many species, but there are three main species including Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. Over 70 compounds isolated from cannabis species are called cannabinoids (CBN). Cannabinoids produce over 100 naturally occurring chemicals. The most abundant chemicals are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD). THC is psychotropic chemical that makes people feel \"high\" while CBD is nonpsychotropic chemical. However, cannabinoid chemicals are not found only in the cannabis plant, they are also produced by the mammalian body, called endocannabinoids and in the laboratory, called synthesized cannabinoids. Endocannabinoids are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian central nervous system including brain and peripheral nervous system. There are at least two types of endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) which are G-protein coupled receptors. CB1 receptors are particularly abundant in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, hypothalamus and cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. They are present in inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons and excitatory glutamatergic neurons. CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the immune system, hematopoietic cells and glia cells. CB2 is mainly expressed in the periphery under normal healthy condition, but in conditions of disease or injury, this upregulation occurs within the brain, and CB2 is therefore expressed in the brain in unhealthy states. Cannabis and cannabinoid are studied in different medical conditions. The therapeutic potentials of both cannabis and cannabinoid are related to the effects of THC, CBD and other cannabinoid compounds. However, the \"high\" effect of THC in cannabis and cannabinoid may limit the clinical use, particularly, the study on the therapeutic potential of THC alone is more limited.

Macroscopic atrophy affects the entorhinal area and hippocampus, amygdala, and associative regions of the neocortex. Braak advocates the spread of tau deposits from the entorhinal to associative regions of the neocortex as the disease progresses.

However, AD is also accompanied by amyloid-\u03b2 deposition and even atrophy. Although it is possible to make a neuropathological diagnosis of AD from the spread of amyloid and tau depositions, neuropathological abnormal protein accumulation cannot explain all clinical symptoms of AD. There is an ambiguity between clinical symptoms and neuropathological findings. It is important to understand neuropathological findings while understanding that this ambiguity exists.

Genetic variants in presenilin (PSEN) 1 and 2 genes lead to autosomal dominant early-onset AD (ADAD); patients with PSEN gene variants also report seizures. Pharmacological control of seizures in AD may be disease-modifying. Preclinical efficacy of FDA-approved antiseizure drugs (ASDs) is well defined in young adult rodents; however, the efficacy of ASDs in aged rodents with chronic seizures is less clear. The mechanism by which ADAD genes lead to AD remains unclear, and even less studied is the pathogenesis of epilepsy in AD. PSEN variants generally all result in a biochemical loss of function (De Strooper, 2007). We herein determined whether well-established models of acute and chronic seizure could be used to explore the relationship between AD genes and seizures through investigating whether loss of normal PSEN2 function age-dependently influenced susceptibility to seizures and/or corneal kindling acquisition. PSEN2 knockout (KO) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice were screened from 2- to 10-months-old to establish age-dependent focal seizure threshold. Additionally, PSEN2 KO and WT mice aged 2- and 8-months-old underwent corneal kindling such that mice were aged 3- and 9-months old at the beginning of ASD efficacy testing. We then defined the dose-dependent efficacy of mechanistically distinct ASDs on kindled seizures of young versus aged mice to better understand the applicability of corneal kindling to real-world use for geriatric patients. PSEN2 KO mice demonstrated early-life reductions in seizure threshold. However, kindling acquisition was delayed in 2-month-old PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. Young male WT mice took 24.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 (S.E.M.) stimulations to achieve kindling criterion, whereas age-matched PSEN2 KO male mice took 41.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 stimulations (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The rate of kindling acquisition of 8-month-old mice was no longer different from WT. This study demonstrates that loss of normal PSEN2 function is associated with age-dependent changes in the in vivo susceptibility to acute seizures and kindling. Loss of normal PSEN2 function may be an underexplored molecular contributor to seizures.

It is ten times more toxic to neurons than lead. This study was created to determine if mercury could be causing Alzheimer's disease (AD) by cross referencing the effects of mercury with 70 factors associated with AD. The results found that all these factors could be attributed to mercury. The hallmark changes in AD include plaques, beta amyloid protein, neurofibrillary tangles, phosphorylated tau protein, and memory loss-all changes that can be caused by mercury. Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine are inhibited in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with the same inhibition occurring in mercury toxicity. Enzyme dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease include BACE 1, gamma secretase, cyclooxygenase-2, cytochrome-c-oxidase, protein kinases, monoamine oxidase, nitric oxide synthetase, acetyl choline transferase, and caspases, all which can be explained by mercury toxicity. Immune and inflammatory responses seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease also occur when cells are exposed to mercury, including complement activation, cytokine expression, production of glial fibrillary acid protein antibodies and interleukin-1, transforming growth factor, beta 2 microglobulins, and phosphodiesterase 4 stimulation. Genetic factors in patients with Alzheimer's disease are also associated with mercury. Apolipoprotein E 4 allele increases the toxicity of mercury. Mercury can inhibit DNA synthesis in the hippocampus, and has been associated with genetic mutations of presenilin 1 and 2, found in AD. The abnormalities of minerals and vitamins, specifically aluminum, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc, and vitamins B1, B12, E, and C, that occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease, also occur in mercury toxicity. Aluminum has been found to increase mercury's toxicity. Likewise, similar biochemical factors in AD are affected by mercury, including changes in blood levels of homocysteine, arachidonic acid, DHEA sulfate, glutathione, hydrogen peroxide, glycosamine glycans, acetyl-L carnitine, melatonin, and HDL. Other factors seen in Alzheimer's disease, such as increased platelet activation, poor odor identification, hypertension, depression, increased incidences of herpes virus and chlamydia infections, also occur in mercury exposure. In addition, patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease exhibit higher levels of brain mercury, blood mercury, and tissue mercury in some studies.

Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25\u00a0AD) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively.

MAPK-activated protein kinase II (MK2), downstream kinase of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 MAPK, was unveiled as a promising option for the treatment of AD. Increasing evidence points at MK2 as involved in neuroinflammatory responses. MMI-0100, a cell-penetrating peptide inhibitor of MK2, exhibits anti-inflammatory effects and is in current clinical trials for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, it is important to understand the actions of MMI-0100 in neuroinflammation. Methods: The mouse memory function was evaluated using novel object recognition (NOR) and object location recognition (OLR) tasks. Brain hippocampus tissue samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and immunostaining. Near-infrared fluorescent and confocal microscopy experiments were used to detect the brain uptake and distribution after intranasal MMI-0100 application. Results: Central MMI-0100 was able to ameliorate the memory deficit induced by A\u03b21-42 or LPS in novel object and location memory tasks. MMI-0100 suppressed LPS-induced activation of astrocytes and microglia, and dramatically decreased a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, COX-2, and iNOS via inhibiting phosphorylation of MK2, but not ERK, JNK, and p38 in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, one of the reasons for the failure of macromolecular protein or peptide drugs in the treatment of AD is that they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Our data showed that intranasal administration of MMI-0100 significantly ameliorates the memory deficit induced by A\u03b21-42 or LPS. Near-infrared fluorescent and confocal microscopy experiment results showed that a strong fluorescent signal, coming from mouse brains, was observed at 2 h after nasal applications of Cy7.5-MMI-0100.

Using approach involving an inducible neurogenin-2 transgene, we have established a robust and reproducible protocol for differentiating human iPSCs into glutamatergic neurons. The AD-iN cultures that result have mature phenotypic and physiological properties, together with AD-like biochemical features that include extracellular \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation and Tau protein phosphorylation. By screening using a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach, Graptopetalum paraguayense (GP) has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent for AD from among a range of Chinese herbal medicines. We found that administration of a GP extract caused a significantly reduction in the AD-associated phenotypes of the iNs, including decreased levels of extracellular A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, as well as reduced Tau protein phosphorylation at positions Ser214 and Ser396. Additionally, the effect of GP was more prominent in AD-iNs compared to non-diseased controls. These findings provide valuable information that suggests moving extracts of GP toward drug development, either for treating AD or as a health supplement to prevent AD.

Current therapeutic approaches have primarily aimed to reduce pathological aggregates of either A\u03b2 or tau, yet phase 3 clinical trials of these approaches have thus far failed to delay disease progression in humans. Strong preclinical evidence indicates that these two abnormally aggregated proteins interact synergistically to drive downstream neurodegeneration. Therefore, combinatorial therapies that concurrently target both A\u03b2 and tau might be needed for effective disease modification.A combinatorial vaccination approach was designed to concurrently target both A\u03b2 and tau pathologies. Tau22/5xFAD (T5x) bigenic mice that develop both pathological A\u03b2 and tau aggregates were injected intramuscularly with a mixture of two MultiTEP epitope vaccines: AV-1959R and AV-1980R, targeting A\u03b2 and tau, respectively, and formulated in AdvaxCpG, a potent polysaccharide adjuvant. Antibody responses of vaccinated animals were measured by ELISA, and neuropathological changes were determined in brain homogenates of vaccinated and control mice using ELISA and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) multiplex assays.T5x mice immunized with a mixture of A\u03b2- and tau-targeting vaccines generated high A\u03b2- and tau-specific antibody titers that recognized senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles/neuropil threads in human AD brain sections.

Currently, drug development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease has encountered serious difficulties. Our newly proposed solution is to accelerate the aggregation of A\u03b2 to reduce the amount of cytotoxic A\u03b2 oligomers in brain tissue. This strategy differs from the existing strategy of reducing the total A\u03b2 content and the number of amyloid plaques.In this study, we screened a small library and found that a flavonoid compound (ZGM1) promoted the aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). We further verified the binding of ZGM1 to A\u03b242 using a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay. Subsequently, we used dot blotting (DB), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT) measurements to study the aggregation of A\u03b2 under the influence of ZGM1. By using cell experiments, we determined whether ZGM1 can inhibit the cytotoxicity of A\u03b2. Finally, we studied the protective effects of ZGM1 on cognitive function in APPswe/PS1 mice via behavioral experiments and measured the number of plaques in the mouse brain by thioflavin staining.ZGM1 can bind with A\u03b2 directly and mediate a new A\u03b2 assembly process to form reticular aggregates and reduce the amount of A\u03b2 oligomers. Animal experiments showed that ZGM1 can significantly improve cognitive dysfunction and that A\u03b2 plaque deposition in the brain tissue of mice in the drug-administered group was significantly increased.Our research suggests that promoting A\u03b2 aggregation is a promising treatment method for AD and deserves further investigation.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Models, Animal", "Flavonoids", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Presenilin-1", "Protein Aggregates", "Treatment Outcome"]}, "31847859": {"ArticleTitle": "Genetic deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase delays the progression of Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a bifunctional enzyme with COOH-terminal hydrolase and NH2-terminal lipid phosphatase activities.

Previous clinical trials testing whether cholinesterase inhibitors can slow the rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia have yielded disappointing results.

Because few rTMS trials have been conducted in MCI, we designed a trial to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Yet, in both MCI and AD, we know little about what site of stimulation would be ideal for improving cognitive function. Therefore, two cortical sites will be investigated in this trial: (1) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which has been well studied for treatment of major depressive disorder; and (2) the lateral parietal cortex (LPC), a novel site with connectivity to AD-relevant limbic regions.In this single-site trial, we plan to enroll 99 participants with single or multi-domain amnestic MCI. We will randomize participants to one of three groups: (1) Active DLPFC rTMS; (2) Active LPC rTMS; and (3) Sham rTMS (evenly split between DLPFC and LPC locations). After completing 20 bilateral rTMS treatment sessions, participants will be followed for 6\u2009months to test short-term efficacy and track durability of effects. The primary efficacy measure is the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), assessed 1\u2009week after intervention. Secondary analyses will examine effects of rTMS on other cognitive measures, symptoms of depression, and brain function with respect to the site of stimulation. Finally, selected biomarkers will be analyzed to explore predictors of response and mechanisms of action.The primary aim of this trial is to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Additionally, the project will provide information on the durability of cognitive effects and potentially distinct effects of stimulating DLPFC versus LPC regions. Future efforts would be directed toward better understanding therapeutic mechanisms and optimizing rTMS for treatment of MCI. Ultimately, if rTMS can be utilized to slow the rate of progression to AD dementia, this will be a significant advancement in the field.Clinical Trials NCT03331796.

Therefore, information fusion strategies with multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI (VBM-MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have shown their effectiveness for AD diagnosis. However, most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multi-modal data, but do not make full use of structure information across the different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection method with consistent metric constraint (MFCC) for AD analysis. First, the similarity is calculated for each modality (i.e. VBM-MRI or FDG-PET) individually by random forest strategy, which can extract pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities. Then the group sparsity regularization term and the sample similarity constraint regularization term are used to constrain the objective function to conduct feature selection from multiple modalities. Finally, the multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different models for final classification. The experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the proposed method has better classification performance than the start-of-the-art multimodality-based methods. Specifically, we achieved higher accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for AD versus normal controls (NC), MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) on ADNI datasets.

We use machine-learning tools integrating multimodal measures such as cognitive scores (executive functions and cognitive screening) and brain atrophy volume (voxel based morphometry from fronto-temporo-insular regions in bvFTD, and temporo-parietal regions in AD) to identify the most relevant features in predicting the incidence of the diseases. In the Country-1 cohort, predictions of AD and bvFTD became maximally improved upon inclusion of cognitive screenings outcomes combined with atrophy levels. Multimodal training data from this cohort allowed predicting both AD and bvFTD in the other two novel datasets from other countries with high accuracy (>90%), demonstrating the robustness of the approach as well as the differential specificity and reliability of behavioral and neural markers for each condition.

Two patients with Alzheimer's disease are reported with clinically suspected NCSE presenting in the emergency setting who were diagnosed using arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) sequences. CASE REPORT In Case 1, a 69-year-old woman with mild Alzheimer's disease and diabetes presented with acute worsening of cognitive status and fluctuating level of consciousness. In Case 2, a 70-year-old man with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and hypertension presented with acute loss of consciousness and left hemiparesis, without evidence of hypoglycemia or a hypertensive crisis. In both cases, ASL-MRI perfusion images showed focal cerebral hyperperfusion in the posterior cingulate and parietal associative cortex, which involved neurodegenerative areas associated with epilepsy in early Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, the patients developed generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures that lasted for 5 minutes or more, which indicated the emergence of status epilepticus that developed from the initial presentation of NCSE. In both cases, electroencephalogram (EEG) findings confirmed that the seizures were controlled by intravenous administration of antiepileptic drugs.

As the average age of individuals in the United States and the world increases, the prevalence of AD will continue to grow. To address this public health problem, the research community has developed computational approaches to sift through various aspects of clinical data and uncover their insights, among which one of the most challenging problem is to determine the biological mechanisms that cause AD to develop. To study this problem, in this paper we present a novel Joint Multi-Modal Longitudinal Regression and Classification method and show how it can be used to identify the cognitive status of the participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and the underlying biological mechanisms. By intelligently combining clinical data of various modalities (i.e., genetic information and brain scans) using a variety of regularizations that can identify AD-relevant biomarkers, we perform the regression and classification tasks simultaneously. Because the proposed objective is a non-smooth optimization problem that is difficult to solve in general, we derive an efficient iterative algorithm and rigorously prove its convergence. To validate our new method in predicting the cognitive scores of patients and their clinical diagnosis, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the ADNI cohort. Our promising results demonstrate the benefits and flexibility of the proposed method. We anticipate that our new method is of interest to clinical communities beyond AD research and have open-sourced the code of our method online.11 The code package for the proposed Joint Multi-Modal Longitudinal Regression and Classification model have been made publicly available online at https://github.com/minds-mines/jmmlrc.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Neuroimaging"]}, "31840420": {"ArticleTitle": "The Regulatory Functionality of Exosomes Derived from hUMSCs in 3D Culture for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.", "AbstractText": "Reducing amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation could be a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

With increasing dopamine deficiency, metabolic connectivity showed strong deteriorations in distinct brain regions implicated in disease symptoms, with greatest disruptions in the basal ganglia and limbic system, coincident with the pattern of relative hypermetabolism.Relative glucose hypermetabolism and disturbed metabolic connectivity of limbic and basal ganglia circuits are metabolic correlates of dopamine deficiency in dementia with Lewy bodies.

Here, we report that MKP-1 levels were decreased in the brain tissues of patients with AD and an AD mouse model. The reduction in MKP-1 gene expression appeared to be a result of transcriptional inhibition via transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) cis-acting binding elements in the MKP-1 gene promoter. Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced Sp1 activation decreased MKP-1 expression.

Therefore, brain arrhythmias could have catastrophic effects on circuit function, underlying the symptoms of various neurological diseases.

The improvement of neurobehavioral functions in APP/PS1 mice treated with CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC was related to the inhibition of microglial neurotoxicity and promotion of hippocampal neurogenesis. Transplantation of CX3CL1-Wnt3a-MSC also regulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/activated protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling to inhibit the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2).

Since 2013, deep learning has begun to gain considerable attention in AD detection research, with the number of published papers in this area increasing drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for classification, it requires a highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns. This paper reviews the current state of AD detection using deep learning. Through a systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out the most recent findings and trends. Specifically, we review useful biomarkers and features (personal information, genetic data, and brain scans), the necessary pre-processing steps, and different ways of dealing with neuroimaging data originating from single-modality and multi-modality studies.

Different from existing methods that separately deal with each single view, this paper proposes a discriminative Margin-Sensitive Autoencoder (MSAE) framework for automated Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and accurate protein fold recognition. Generally, our MSAE aims to collaboratively explore the complementary properties of multi-view bioimage features in a semantic-sensitive encoder-decoder paradigm, where the discriminative semantic space is explicitly constructed in a margin-scalable regression model. Specifically, we develop a semantic-sensitive autoencoder, where an encoder projects multi-view visual features into the common semantic-aware latent space, and a decoder is exerted as an additional constraint to reconstruct the respective visual features. In particular, the importance of different views is adaptively weighted by self-adjusting learning scheme, such that their underlying correlations and complementary characteristics across multiple views are simultaneously preserved into the latent common representations. Moreover, a flexible semantic space is formulated by a margin-scalable support vector machine to improve the discriminability of the learning model. Importantly, correntropy induced metric is exploited as a robust regularization measurement to better control outliers for effective classification. A half-quadratic minimization and alternating learning strategy are devised to optimize the resulting framework such that each subproblem exists a closed-form solution in each iterative minimization phase. Extensive experimental results performed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets show that our MSAE can achieve superior performances for both binary and multi-class classification in AD diagnosis, and evaluations on protein folds demonstrate that our method can achieve very encouraging performance on protein structure recognition, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Databases, Factual", "Discrimination Learning", "Humans", "Neuroimaging", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Support Vector Machine"]}, "31837501": {"ArticleTitle": "Design, synthesis and evaluation of diosgenin carbamate derivatives as multitarget anti-Alzheimer's disease agents.", "AbstractText": "In order to produce an effective and multi-targeted clinical drug that could prevent progressive neurodegeneration, a series of diosgenin carbamate derivatives were designed, synthesized and tested for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-A\u03b2 activities.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status.

Indeed, more than 200 investigational programs have failed or have been abandoned in the last decade. The most probable explanations for failures of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for AD may include late initiation of treatments during the course of AD development, inappropriate drug dosages, erroneous selection of treatment targets, and mainly an inadequate understanding of the complex pathophysiology of AD, which may necessitate combination treatments rather than monotherapy. Clinical trials' methodological issues have also been criticized. Drug-development research for AD is aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Preclinical and prodromal AD populations, as well as traditionally investigated populations representing all the clinical stages of AD, are included in recent trials. Systematic use of biomarkers in staging preclinical and prodromal AD and of a single primary outcome in trials of prodromal AD are regularly integrated. The application of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers, including new biomarkers-such as Tau positron emission tomography, neurofilament light chain (blood and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker of axonal degeneration) and neurogranin (CSF biomarker of synaptic functioning)-to clinical trials allows more precise staging of AD. Additionally, use of Bayesian statistics, modifiable clinical trial designs, and clinical trial simulators enrich the trial methodology. Besides, combination therapy regimens are assessed in clinical trials. The above-mentioned diagnostic and statistical advances, which have been recently integrated in clinical trials, are relevant to the recent failures of studies of disease-modifying treatments.

Understanding reference requires the listener to keep track of the unfolding discourse history while integrating multiple sources of information to interpret the speech stream as it unfolds in time. Pronouns are a common way to establish reference. But due to their impoverished form, to understand them listeners must relate features of the pronoun (e.g., gender, animacy) with existing representations of potential discourse referents. Successful referential processing seems to place demands on memory. In a previous study, patients with hippocampal amnesia and healthy participants listened to short stories as their eye movements were monitored. When interpreting ambiguous pronouns, healthy participants demonstrated order-of-mention effects, whereby ambiguous pronouns are interpreted as referring to the first-mentioned referent in the story. By contrast, memory-impaired patients exhibited significant disruptions in their ability to use information about which character had been mentioned first to interpret pronouns. Repetition of the most salient information is a common clinical recommendation for improving pronoun resolution and communication in individuals with memory disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) but this recommendation lacks an evidentiary basis. The present study seeks to determine whether the pronoun resolution performance of hippocampal patients can be improved, by repetition of the target referent, increasing its salience. Results indicate that patients with hippocampal damage demonstrate improved processing of pronouns following repetition of the target referent, but benefit from this repetition to a significantly smaller degree compared to healthy participants.

In neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a compromised energy production, impaired calcium buffering, activation of proteases and phospholipases, and increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced microglial cells activation, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to neuronal deaths in these disorders.Role of nutrition: Neurodegenerative disease is not curable, but treatment is available to manage the symptoms and slow down the disease progression.

Combined pharmacological, immunological and genetic approaches (presenilin invalidation and C99 dimerization mutants (GXXXG)) were used to characterize vesicle-containing APP-CTFs. Subcellular APP-CTF localization was determined by immunocytochemistry.Purified EVs from both AD cell or mouse models were enriched in APP-CTFs as compared to EVs from control cells/brains. Surprisingly, EVs from D6-treated cells not only displayed increased C99 and C99-derived C83 levels but also higher molecular weight (HMW) APP-CTF-immunoreactivities that were hardly detectable in whole cell extracts. Accordingly, the intracellular levels of HMW APP-CTFs were amplified by the exosomal inhibitor GW4869. By combined pharmacological, immunological and genetic approaches, we established that these HMW APP-CTFs correspond to oligomeric APP-CTFs composed of C99 and/or C83. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that monomers were localized mainly to the trans-Golgi network, whereas oligomers were confined to endosomes and lysosomes, thus providing an anatomical support for the selective recovery of HMW APP-CTFs in EVs. The D6-induced APP-CTF oligomerization and subcellular mislocalization was indeed due to \u03b3-secretase blockade, since it similarly occurred in presenilin-deficient fibroblasts. Further, our data proposed that besides favoring APP-CTF oligomerization by preventing C99 proteolysis, \u03b3-secretase inhibiton also led to a defective SorLA-mediated retrograde transport of HMW APP-CTFs from endosomal compartments to the TGN.This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of oligomeric APP-CTFs in AD mouse models, the levels of which are selectively enriched in endolysosomal compartments including exosomes and amplified by \u03b3-secretase inhibition.

Although several pioneering studies have been devoted to automated AD diagnosis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), their performance is somewhat limited due to non-effective mining of spatial-temporal dependency. Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus capturing the temporal dynamics along time. We evaluate the proposed method on 174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our method in both tasks of disease progression prediction and AD-related hub detection.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Neuroimaging"]}, "31825838": {"ArticleTitle": "Amyloid Beta and Tau Cooperate to Cause Reversible Behavioral and Transcriptional Deficits in a Model of Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "A key knowledge gap blocking development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the lack of understanding of how amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide and pathological forms of the tau protein cooperate in causing disease phenotypes.

In this article I describe a hypothesis on the entire pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, based on the most wellknown pathological elements in AD, filling the gaps with hypothetical mechanisms. This proposed mechanism of derailed repair starts with an insufficiently increased level of injury signalling in the axon by ApoE, DLK, APP, BACE-1, A\u03b2 and iPLA2\u03b2, followed by an excessive repair response induced by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, release of mitochondrial CoA and activation of palmitoylation and massive endocytosis. Excessive compounds, associated with injury signalling and repair, start to accumulate, adding to axonal injury. This increased activation of the repair mechanism causes exhaustion of the repair response by lack of mitochondrial CoA. A vicious circle of increased injury signalling and insufficient repair ensues.

Targeted metabolomics analysis of serum samples was performed using the Biocrates Absolute-IDQ P180 kit. Targeted metabolic data were analyzed by TargetLynx, and MetIDQ software was applied to integrate the metabolites by automated calculation of metabolite concentrations. Results: The datasets of targeted metabolite analysis were analyzed by the orthogonal-projection-to-latent-structure-discriminant-analysis (OPLS-DA) model. The OPLS-DA score plots demonstrated considerable separation between the MCI and early-stage AD patients.

These alterations were studied in the pillar of the fornix (PoF), an axonal tract, to analyse the role of axons in their propagation. The PoF axons mainly originate from the subicular neurons and project to the mamillary body. Forty-seven post-mortem cases at various Braak stages (Tau) and Thal phases (A\u03b2) were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of the lesions showed that the subiculum was affected before the mamillary body, but neither Tau aggregation nor A\u03b2 deposition was consistently first. The subiculum and the mamillary body contained Gallyas positive neurofibrillary tangles, immunolabelled by AT8, TG3, PHF1, Alz50 and C3 Tau antibodies. In the PoF, only thin and fragmented threads were observed, exclusively in the cases with neurofibrillary tangles in the subiculum. The threads were made of Gallyas negative, AT8 and TG3 positive Tau. They were intra-axonal and devoid of paired helical filaments at electron microscopy. We tested PoF homogenates containing Tau AT8 positive axons in a Tau P301S biosensor HEK cell line and found a seeding activity. There was no A\u03b2 immunoreactivity detected in the PoF. We could follow microcryodissected AT8 positive axons entering the mamillary body; contacts between Tau positive endings and A\u03b2 positive diffuse or focal deposits were observed in CLARITY-cleared mamillary body. In conclusion, we show that non-fibrillary, hyperphosphorylated Tau is transported by the axons of the PoF from the subiculum to the mamillary body and has a seeding activity.

We demonstrate that the CX3CL1 C-terminal domain can upregulate neurogenesis, which may ameliorate neurodegeneration. Here we generated transgenic (Tg-CX3CL1) mice by overexpressing CX3CL1 in neurons. Tg-CX3CL1 mice exhibit enhanced neurogenesis in both subgranular and subventricular zones. This enhanced neurogenesis correlates well with elevated expression of TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23, and activation of their downstream signaling molecule Smad2. Intriguingly, the enhanced adult neurogenesis was mitigated when Smad2 expression was deleted in neurons, supporting a role for the CX3CL1-TGF-\u03b22/3-Smad2 pathway in the control of adult neurogenesis. When Tg-CX3CL1 mice were crossed with Alzheimer's PS19 mice, which overexpress a tau P301S mutation and exhibit age-dependent neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, overexpressed CX3CL1 in both male and female mice was sufficient to rescue the neurodegeneration, increase survival time, and improve cognitive function. Hence, we provide in vivo evidence that CX3CL1 is a strong activator of adult neurogenesis, and that it reduces neuronal loss and improves cognitive function in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study will be the first to demonstrate that enhanced neurogenesis by overexpressed CX3CL1 is mitigated by disruption of Smad2 signaling and is independent of its interaction with CX3CR1. Overexpression of CX3CL1 lengthens the life span of PS19 tau mice by enhancing adult neurogenesis while having minimal effect on tau pathology.

Statistically TWAS is a (two-sample) 2-stage least squares (2SLS) method in the framework of instrumental variables analysis for causal inference: in Stage 1 it uses the reference eQTL data to impute a genes expression for the main GWAS data, then in Stage 2 it tests for association between the imputed gene expression and the GWAS trait; if an association is detected in Stage 2, a (putatively) causal relationship between the gene and the GWAS trait is claimed. If a nonlinear model or a generalized linear model (GLM) is fitted in Stage 2 (e.g., for a binary GWAS trait), it is known that using only imputed gene expression, as in standard TWAS, in general does not lead to a consistent (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) estimate for the causal effect; accordingly, a variation of 2SLS, called two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), has been proposed to yield better estimates (e.g., being consistent under suitable conditions). Our main goal is to investigate whether it is necessary or even better to apply 2SRI, instead of the standard 2SLS. In addition, due to the use of imputed gene expression (i.e., with measurement errors), it is known that in general some correction to the standard error estimate of the causal effect estimate has to be applied, while in the standard TWAS no correction is applied.

Evidence suggests that cognitive dysfunction is a rising complication of diabetes which adversely affects the brain of patients suffering from diabetes. Age-related memory impairment is a complication having its major effect on people suffering from diabetes and Alzheimer's. Patients suffering from diabetes are at two times higher risk of developing cognitive dysfunction as compared with normal individuals. Multiple factors which are involved in diabetes related complications are found to play a role in the development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's. The problem of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance is well reported in diabetes but there are many studies which suggest dysregulation of insulin levels as a reason behind the development of Alzheimer's. As the link between diabetes and Alzheimer disease (AD) is deepening, there is a need to understand the plausible tie-ins between the two.

To date, there is no effective treatment for AD, and thus, to enhance neurogenesis in the AD brain may be a therapeutic strategy.

In this study, we examined the function of mitochondrial protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in the pathogenesis of AD. Compared with AppPs1 mice, Sirt3-haploinsufficient AppPs1 mice (Sirt3+/-AppPs1) exhibit early epileptiform EEG activity and seizure. Both male and female Sirt3+/-AppPs1 mice were observed to die prematurely before 5 months of age. When comparing male mice among different genotypes, Sirt3 haploinsufficiency renders GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex vulnerable to degeneration and associated neuronal network hyperexcitability. Feeding Sirt3+/-AppPs1 AD mice with a ketone ester-rich diet increases SIRT3 expression and prevents seizure-related death and the degeneration of GABAergic neurons, indicating that the aggravated GABAergic neuron loss and neuronal network hyperexcitability in Sirt3+/-AppPs1 mice are caused by SIRT3 reduction and can be rescued by increase of SIRT3 expression. Consistent with a protective role in AD, SIRT3 levels are reduced in association with cerebral cortical A\u03b2 pathology in AD patients. In summary, SIRT3 preserves GABAergic interneurons and protects cerebral circuits against hyperexcitability, and this neuroprotective mechanism can be bolstered by dietary ketone esters.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT GABAergic neurons provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain.

This disorder is characterized by the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques (A\u03b2) resulting from impaired amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, together with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. The exacerbated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggers the process called oxidative stress, which increases neuronal cell abnormalities, most often followed by apoptosis, leading to cognitive dysfunction and dementia. In this context, the development of new therapies for the AD treatment is necessary. Antioxidants, for instance, are promising species for prevention and treatment because they are capable of disrupting the radical chain reaction, reducing the production of ROS.

The frontal cortex, an important brain structure for executive function, is one of the regions affected by AD. We investigated the beneficial effects of active compounds of Epimedium, Astragaoside and Puerarin on iron metabolism in the frontal cortex of six-month-old APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mouse, a model of AD. Treatment with the active compounds reduced cognitive and memory deficits and damaged cell ultrastructure in APP/PS1 mice. These beneficial effects were associated with changes in expression levels of iron metabolism proteins in the frontal cortex, including divalent metal transporter with iron response element (DMT1-with IRE), divalent metal transporter without iron response element (DMT1-without IRE), transferrin (TF) and transferring receptor 1 (TfR1); three release proteins including the exporter ferroportin 1 (Fpn1), ceruloplasmin (CP) and hephaestin (HEPH), one increased storage iron protein ferritin and one iron regulating hormone hepcidin.

In other words, in many cases we can access to plenty of information on ligands that bind to specific protein, but less or almost no information showing that compounds don't bind to proteins of interest. In this paper, we suggested an approach to comprehensively explore candidates for ligands specifically targeting toward proteins without using information on the true negative interaction. The approach consists of 4 steps: 1) constructing a model that distinguishes ligands for the target proteins of interest from those targeting proteins that cause off-target effects, by using graph convolution neural network (GCNN); 2) extracting feature vectors after convolution/pooling processes and mapping their principal components in two dimensions; 3) specifying regions with higher density for two ligand groups through kernel density estimation; and 4) investigating the distribution of compounds for exploration on the density map using the same classifier and decomposer. If compounds for exploration are located in higher-density regions of ligand compounds, these compounds can be regarded as having relatively high binding affinity to the major target or off-target proteins compared with other compounds. We applied the approach to the exploration of ligands for \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein [APP]-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a major target for Alzheimer Disease (AD), with less off-target effect toward cathepsin D.

The bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), has been extensively studied in cardiovascular diseases and digestive diseases. However, the role of FXR in AD is not yet understood. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of FXR function in AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Lentivirus infection, flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and western blotting were used to detect the gain or loss of FXR in cell apoptosis induced by A\u00df. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the molecular partners involved in A\u00df-induced apoptosis. RESULTS We found that the mRNA and protein expression of FXR was enhanced in Ab-triggered neuronal apoptosis in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and in mouse hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of FXR aggravated A\u00df-triggered neuronal apoptosis in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was further increased by treatment with the FXR agonist 6ECDCA. Molecular mechanism analysis by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting revealed that FXR interacted with the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), leading to decreased CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels. Low expression of FXR mostly reversed the A\u00df-triggered neuronal apoptosis effect and prevented the reduction in CREB and BDNF.

In this study, we aimed to complement previous phenotypic studies by doing an international study of age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration in individuals with mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72.In this international, retrospective cohort study, we collected data on age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration for patients with pathogenic mutations in the GRN and MAPT genes and pathological expansions in the C9orf72 gene through the Frontotemporal Dementia Prevention Initiative and from published papers. We used mixed effects models to explore differences in age at onset, age at death, and disease duration between genetic groups and individual mutations. We also assessed correlations between the age at onset and at death of each individual and the age at onset and at death of their parents and the mean age at onset and at death of their family members. Lastly, we used mixed effects models to investigate the extent to which variability in age at onset and at death could be accounted for by family membership and the specific mutation carried.Data were available from 3403 individuals from 1492 families: 1433 with C9orf72 expansions (755 families), 1179 with GRN mutations (483 families, 130 different mutations), and 791 with MAPT mutations (254 families, 67 different mutations). Mean age at symptom onset and at death was 49\u00b75 years (SD 10\u00b70; onset) and 58\u00b75 years (11\u00b73; death) in the MAPT group, 58\u00b72 years (9\u00b78; onset) and 65\u00b73 years (10\u00b79; death) in the C9orf72 group, and 61\u00b73 years (8\u00b78; onset) and 68\u00b78 years (9\u00b77; death) in the GRN group. Mean disease duration was 6\u00b74 years (SD 4\u00b79) in the C9orf72 group, 7\u00b71 years (3\u00b79) in the GRN group, and 9\u00b73 years (6\u00b74) in the MAPT group. Individual age at onset and at death was significantly correlated with both parental age at onset and at death and with mean family age at onset and at death in all three groups, with a stronger correlation observed in the MAPT group (r=0\u00b745 between individual and parental age at onset, r=0\u00b763 between individual and mean family age at onset, r=0\u00b758 between individual and parental age at death, and r=0\u00b769 between individual and mean family age at death) than in either the C9orf72 group (r=0\u00b732 individual and parental age at onset, r=0\u00b736 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0\u00b738 individual and parental age at death, and r=0\u00b740 individual and mean family age at death) or the GRN group (r=0\u00b722 individual and parental age at onset, r=0\u00b718 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0\u00b722 individual and parental age at death, and r=0\u00b732 individual and mean family age at death). Modelling showed that the variability in age at onset and at death in the MAPT group was explained partly by the specific mutation (48%, 95% CI 35-62, for age at onset; 61%, 47-73, for age at death), and even more by family membership (66%, 56-75, for age at onset; 74%, 65-82, for age at death). In the GRN group, only 2% (0-10) of the variability of age at onset and 9% (3-21) of that of age of death was explained by the specific mutation, whereas 14% (9-22) of the variability of age at onset and 20% (12-30) of that of age at death was explained by family membership. In the C9orf72 group, family membership explained 17% (11-26) of the variability of age at onset and 19% (12-29) of that of age at death.Our study showed that age at symptom onset and at death of people with genetic frontotemporal dementia is influenced by genetic group and, particularly for MAPT mutations, by the specific mutation carried and by family membership. Although estimation of age at onset will be an important factor in future pre-symptomatic therapeutic trials for all three genetic groups, our study suggests that data from other members of the family will be particularly helpful only for individuals with MAPT mutations.

Using site-specific binding titrations, we show that the recruitment of A\u03b2 oligomers primarily occurs via the electrostatic interaction between the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of PrP and A\u03b2 oligomers. Our results demonstrate that OC-positive fibrillar oligomers possessing in-register parallel \u03b2-sheet packing displayed \u223c30 times stronger binding with PrP compared to A11-positive oligomers.

At the end of the PET scans, brains were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis of ABCB1 and A\u03b2 levels. In separate groups of mice, radiolabeled metabolites of 11C-metoclopramide were determined in plasma and brain at 15 min after radiotracer injection. As an outcome parameter of cerebral ABCB1 activity, the elimination slope of radioactivity washout from the brain (k E,brain) was calculated. Results: PCN treatment resulted in an increased clearance of radioactivity from the brain as reflected by significant increases in k E,brain (from +26% to +54% relative to baseline). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed ABCB1 induction in the brains of PCN-treated APP/PS1-21 mice with a concomitant decrease in A\u03b2 levels. There was a significant positive correlation between k E,brain and ABCB1 levels in the brain. In wild-type mice, a significant age-related decrease in k E,brain was found. Metabolite analysis showed that most radioactivity in the brain comprised unmetabolized 11C-metoclopramide in all animal groups. Conclusion: 11C-metoclopramide can measure ABCB1 induction in the mouse brain without the need to consider an arterial input function and may find potential application in Alzheimer disease patients to noninvasively evaluate strategies to enhance the clearance properties of the BBB.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1", "Acyltransferases", "Amyloidosis", "Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Carbon Radioisotopes", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Metoclopramide", "Mice"]}, "31806426": {"ArticleTitle": "Statin Use and Risk of Cognitive Decline in the ADNI Cohort.", "AbstractText": "To investigate associations between statin use and cognitive change, as well as diagnostic conversion, in individuals with cognitively normal (CN) status, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD-dementia).A multicenter cohort study with 1629 adults 48 to 91 years old with CN status, early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), or AD-dementia at baseline followed prospectively for 24 months.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key axonal transport cargo since disruption to APP transport promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Moreover, altered APP processing itself disrupts axonal transport. The mechanisms that regulate axonal transport of APP are therefore directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP is transported anterogradely through axons on kinesin-1 motors and one route for this transport involves calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane spanning protein that acts as a direct ligand for kinesin-1 light chains (KLCs). Thus, loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts APP axonal transport and promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Phosphorylation of KLC1 on serine-460 has been shown to reduce anterograde axonal transport of calsyntenin-1 by inhibiting the KLC1-calsyntenin-1 interaction. Here we demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease frontal cortex, KLC1 levels are reduced and the relative levels of KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation are increased; these changes occur relatively early in the disease process. We also show that a KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant inhibits axonal transport of APP in both mammalian neurons in culture and in Drosophila neurons in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of the KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP.

A diagnosis of dementia is currently made in terms of probability and is based on clinical evaluation (neuropsycological tests) as well as on the results of morphological imaging investigations (MRI) that can be supported by biohumoral (CSF analysis), and functional imaging only in the case of uncertain diagnosis of disease. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of amyloid PET/CT in the management of patients with suspicion of AD, through comparison with instrumental and clinical evaluation.38 consecutive patients with suspicion of AD (23 female, 15 male; median age 63 years old, range 46-72), who performed 18F-florbetaben PET/CT, were retrospectively reviewed. All of them performed a previous instrumental evaluation. A subgroup of patients (24/38) were evaluated with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cohen's K test was used as a measure of agreement between previous instrumental examinations/clinical evaluation and beta-amyloid PET results.Twenty-five/38 (65.8%) amyloid PET/CT scans resulted positive for amyloid deposition. Among the four target regions, precuneus was the most frequently involved. Previous instrumental evaluation was: MRI in 26/38 patients (24/26 positive for atrophy), CT in 9/38 (8/9 positive for atrophy), perfusion SPECT in 12/38 (8/12 areas of hypo-perfusion), 18F-FDG PET/CT in 2/38 (1/2 hypometabolism in frontal cortex). The agreement between previous instrumental examinations and beta-amyloid PET results was low (K= 0.084). In the subgroup of 24/38 patients, MMSE was scored positive (MMSE<24) in 14/24 (58.4%) and negative (MMSE>24) in 10/24 (41.6%). The agreement between clinical evaluation (MMSE) and beta-amyloid PET results was fair (K= 0.217).The low agreement between amyloid PET/CT and previous clinical and instrumental assessments that we found in our study suggests that the amyloid PET/CT provides additional and early information.

Recent research suggests that, in addition to established biomarkers such as CSF A\u00df42, total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau, resting state connectivity established by functional magnetic resonance imaging might also be a feasible biomarker for prodromal stages of AD. In order to explore this possibility, we investigated resting state functional connectivity as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiles in patients with MCI (n = 30; age 66.43 \u00b1 7.06 years) and cognitively healthy controls (n = 38; age 66.89 \u00b1 7.12 years). CSF A\u00df42, total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau concentrations were correlated with measures of cognitive performance (immediate and delayed recall, global cognition, processing speed). Moreover, MCI-related alterations in intrinsic functional connectivity within the default mode network were investigated using functional resting state MRI. As expected, MCI patients showed decreased CSF A\u00df42 and increased total tau concentrations. These alterations were associated with cognitive performance. However, there were no differences between MCI patients and cognitively healthy controls regarding intrinsic functional connectivity.

It has been increasingly important to understand whether relationships exist, and if so how strong, between any two entities extracted from a large number of texts. One of the defining methods is to measure semantic similarity and relatedness between two entities.We propose a hybrid ranking method that combines a co-occurrence approach considering both direct and indirect entity pair relationship with specialized word embeddings for measuring the relatedness of two entities.We evaluate the proposed ranking method comparatively with other well-known methods such as co-occurrence, Word2Vec, COALS (Correlated Occurrence Analog to Lexical Semantics), and random indexing by calculating top-ranked entities related to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we analyze gene, pathway, and gene-phenotype relationships. Overall, the proposed method tends to find more hidden relationships than the other methods.Our proposed method is able to select more useful related entities that not only highly co-occur but also have more indirect relations for the target entity.

Age-related dysregulation of microRNA biogenesis increases neuronal vulnerability to cellular stress and may contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. All major neurodegenerative disorders are also associated with oxidative stress, which is widely recognized as a potential target for protective therapies. Albeit often considered separately, microRNA networks and oxidative stress are inextricably entwined in neurodegenerative processes. Oxidative stress affects expression levels of multiple microRNAs and, conversely, microRNAs regulate many genes involved in an oxidative stress response. Both oxidative stress and microRNA regulatory networks also influence other processes linked to neurodegeneration, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulation of proteostasis, and increased neuroinflammation, which ultimately lead to neuronal death. Modulating the levels of a relatively small number of microRNAs may therefore alleviate pathological oxidative damage and have neuroprotective activity.

Although patients with AD are known to have abnormal circadian rhythms and suffer sleep disturbances, the role of the molecular clock in regulating amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) pathology is still poorly understood. Here, we explored how the circadian repressors REV-ERB\u03b1 and \u03b2 affected A\u03b2 clearance in mouse microglia. We discovered that, at Circadian time 4 (CT4), microglia expressed higher levels of the master clock protein BMAL1 and more rapidly phagocytosed fibrillary A\u03b21-42 (fA\u03b21-42 ) than at CT12. BMAL1 directly drives transcription of REV-ERB proteins, which are implicated in microglial activation. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBs with the small molecule antagonist SR8278 or genetic knockdown of REV-ERBs-accelerated microglial uptake of fA\u03b21-42 and increased transcription of BMAL1. SR8278 also promoted microglia polarization toward a phagocytic M2-like phenotype with increased P2Y12 receptor expression.

The top candidate biomarkers were then tested in an independent cohort for ability to predict state short-term memory, and trait future positive neuropsychological testing for cognitive impairment. The best overall evidence was for a series of new, as well as some previously known genes, which are now newly shown to have functional evidence in humans as blood biomarkers: RAB7A, NPC2, TGFB1, GAP43, ARSB, PER1, GUSB, and MAPT. Additional top blood biomarkers include GSK3B, PTGS2, APOE, BACE1, PSEN1, and TREM2, well known genes implicated in AD by previous brain and genetic studies, in humans and animal models, which serve as reassuring de facto positive controls for our whole-genome gene expression discovery approach. Biological pathway analyses implicate LXR/RXR activation, neuroinflammation, atherosclerosis signaling, and amyloid processing. Co-directionality of expression data provide new mechanistic insights that are consistent with a compensatory/scarring scenario for brain pathological changes.

We also tested the extent that alternative forms of this ability discrepancy measure (e.g., subdomain discrepancies, verbal-visual discrepancies) and an episodic memory composite might also be sensitive markers of early AD pathology.An overall ability discrepancy was linearly and positively correlated with beta- amyloid. A quadratic relationship was found between the overall ability discrepancy score and cortical thickness such that a small positive correlation was found at lower discrepancy levels (fluid > crystallized), but at higher discrepancy levels (crystallized > fluid) a negative relationship was found (i.e., an inverted-U pattern). Similar patterns were found across each subdomain of cognition, but the effects were weaker than the overall ability discrepancy score. Importantly, inclusion of episodic memory (the gold standard) did not alter any of the effects, suggesting that an ability discrepancy confers unique predictiveness of AD biomarkers.These findings replicate previous findings and increase the confidence in their usefulness to predict AD biomarkers.

Besides spontaneous seizures, these mice also display frequent epileptic spiking in epidural EEG recordings, and these have provided a means to test potential drug treatment to AD-related epilepsy. However, the origin of EEG spikes in transgenic AD model mice has remained elusive, which makes it difficult to relate electrophysiology with underlying pathology at the cellular and molecular level. Using multiple cortical and subcortical electrodes in freely moving APP/PS1 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates, we identified several types of epileptic spikes among over 15 800 spikes visible with cortical screw electrodes based on their source localization. Cortical spikes associated with muscle twitches, cortico-hippocampal spikes, and spindle and fast-spindle associated spikes were present equally often in both APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, whereas pure cortical spikes were slightly more common in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, spike-wave discharges, cortico-hippocampal spikes with after hyperpolarization and giant spikes were seen almost exclusively in APP/PS1 mice but only in a subset of them. Interestingly, different subtypes of spikes responded differently to anti-epileptic drugs ethosuximide and levetiracetam. From the translational point most relevant may be the giant spikes generated in the hippocampus that reached an amplitude up to \u00b1 5 mV in the hippocampal channel. As in AD patients, they occurred exclusively during sleep. Further, we could demonstrate that a high number of giant spikes in APP/PS1 mice predicts seizures. These data show that by only adding a pair of hippocampal deep electrodes and EMG to routine cortical epidural screw electrodes and by taking into account underlying cortical oscillations, one can drastically refine the analysis of cortical spike data.

Traditional medicine has used many medicinal plants to alleviate the symptoms of AD. Medicinal plants may reduce neurodegenerative disorders with fewer side effects than chemical drugs, and they are promising drug candidates for AD therapy. This review is the summary of the pathogenesis and treatments of AD and includes information about the chemistry and bioactivities of some medicinal plants from the Huperzia species, such as Huperzia saururus, Huperzia selago, Huperzia phlegmaria, Huperzia fargesii, Huperzia serrata, Huperzia reflexa and Huperzia quadrifariata, that are used for the treatment of AD.

Based on relevant pre-clinical research and a few clinical case reports, we speculate that impaired perivascular space integrity, inflammation, hypoxia, and BBB breakdown after stroke can lead to accelerated deposition of A\u03b2 within brain parenchyma and cerebral vessel walls or exacerbation of CAA. The deposition of A\u03b2 in the parenchyma would then be the initiating event leading to synaptic dysfunction, inducing cognitive decline and dementia.

After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 18 studies were concluded to be eligible for the review.Prevalence studies demonstrated that dementia is indeed a prevalent condition in Arab countries, ranging between 1.1% and 2.3% among age groups of 50 years and older, as well as between 13.5% and 18.5% among age groups of 80 years and above. However, these results are not different from those of many other countries in the world. Moreover, prevalence was found to vary depending on sociodemographic characteristics. Major risk factors of dementia included hypertension, low income, and low education, while the risk of developing dementia is increased by obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the growing evidence regarding the epidemiological distribution and determinants of dementia worldwide, studies from the Arab region remain scarce.This systematic review highlights the need for population-based studies to provide necessary information for developing preventive and curative strategies specific to the Arab region.", "query": "Alzheimer", "mesh": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Arabs", "Dementia", "Humans", "Middle East", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors"]}, "31771980": {"ArticleTitle": "NMR-based site-resolved profiling of \u03b2-amyloid misfolding reveals structural transitions from pathologically relevant spherical oligomer to fibril.", "AbstractText": "Increasing evidence highlights the central role of neurotoxic oligomers of the 42-residue-long \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b242) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first site-specific structural characterization of A\u03b242 misfolding, from toxic oligomeric assembly yielding a similar conformation to an AD-associated A\u03b242 oligomer, into a fibril. Transmission EM (TEM) analysis revealed that a spherical amyloid assembly (SPA) of A\u03b242 with a 15.6 \u00b1 2.1-nm diameter forms in a \u223c30-\u03bcm A\u03b242 solution after a \u223c10-h incubation at 4 \u00b0C, followed by a slow conversion into fibril at \u223c180 h. Immunological analysis suggested that the SPA has a surface structure similar to that of amylospheroid (ASPD), a patient-derived toxic A\u03b2 oligomer, which had a diameter of 10-15 nm in negative-stain TEM. Solid-state NMR analyses indicated that the SPA structure involves a \u03b2-loop-\u03b2 motif, which significantly differed from the triple-\u03b2 motif observed for the A\u03b242 fibril. The comparison of the 13C chemical shifts of SPA with those of the fibril prepared in the above conditions and interstrand distance measurements suggested a large conformational change involving rearrangements of intermolecular \u03b2-sheet into in-register parallel \u03b2-sheet during the misfolding. A comparison of the SPA and ASPD 13C chemical shifts indicated that SPA is structurally similar to the ASPD relevant to AD.

AD background modulated HUCAPS-induced changes on appetitive motivation and olfactory discrimination, specifically enhancing olfactory discrimination in NTg mice. Modeling variation in appetitive motivation as a covariate in spatial learning and memory, however, did not support the conclusion that differences in motivation significantly underlie changes in spatial learning and memory.A short-term inhalation exposure of aged mice to ambient UFPs at human-relevant concentrations resulted in protracted (testing spanning 1-6.5\u2009months post-exposure) adverse effects on multiple memory domains (reference and short-term memory) independent of AD background.

Herein, inspired by heat shock protein, a self-assembly nanochaperone based on mixed-shell polymeric micelle (MSPM) is devised to act as a novel strategy for AD prevention. With unique surface hydrophobic domains, this nanochaperone can selectively capture A\u03b2 peptides, effectively suppress A\u03b2 aggregation, and remarkably reduce A\u03b2-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, the formed nanochaperone-A\u03b2 complex after A\u03b2 adsorption can be easily phagocytosed by microglia and thereby facilitates A\u03b2 clearance. As a result, the nanochaperone reduces A\u03b2 burden, attenuates A\u03b2-induced inflammation, and eventually rescues the cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice.

In recent years, various kinds of fully differentiated cells have been successfully reprogrammed to a desired type of cell in lesion areas. Interestingly, internal glial cells, including astrocytes and NG2 positive cells, were efficiently converted to neuroblasts and neurons by overexpression of some transcription factors (TFs) or microRNAs (miRNAs). Notably, some specific subtypes of neurons have been achieved by in vivo reprogramming and the resulting neurons were successfully integrated into local neuronal circuits. Furthermore, somatic cells from AD patients have been converted to functional neurons. Although direct reprogramming of a patient's own internal cells has revolutionized regenerative medicine, but there are some major obstacles that should be examined before using these induced cells in clinical therapies.

In preliminary assays, various concentrations of Schisandrin were incubated SH-SY5Y cells to establish effects on cell viability and potential toxicity in further experimentation.

Scientists have discovered that the causes of AD may include a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, but the exact cause has not yet been elucidated. Effective strategies to prevent and treat AD therefore remain elusive. The identified genetic causes of AD mainly focus on individual genes, but growing evidence has shown that complex diseases are usually affected by the interaction of genes in a network. Few studies have focused on the interactions and correlations between genes and how they are gradually destroyed or disappear during AD progression. A differential network analysis has been recognized as an essential tool for identifying the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and significant genes for prediction analysis. We therefore aim to conduct a differential network analysis to reveal potential networks involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD and identify genes for AD prediction. Methods: In this paper, we selected 365 samples from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, including 193 clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and 172 no cognitive impairment (NCI) controls. Then, we selected 158 genes belonging to the AD pathway (hsa05010) of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We employed a machine learning method, namely, joint density-based non-parametric differential interaction network analysis and classification (JDINAC), in the analysis of gene expression data (RNA-seq data). We searched for the differential networks in the RNA-seq data with a pathological diagnosis of AD. Finally, an optimal prediction model was built through cross-validation, which showed good discrimination and calibration for AD prediction. Results: We used JDINAC to derive a gene co-expression network and to explore the relationship between the interaction of gene pairs and AD, and the top 10 differential gene pairs were identified. We then compared the prediction performance between JDINAC and individual genes based on prediction methods. JDINAC provides better accuracy of classification than the latest methods, such as random forest and penalized logistic regression.

While there is no consensus regarding the synaptic-relevant species of A\u03b2, it is known that A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) are noticeably increased in the early stages of AD, localizing at or within the synapse. In cell and animal models, A\u03b2Os have been shown to attach to synapses and instigate synapse dysfunction and deterioration. To establish the pathological mechanism of synaptic loss in AD, it will be important to identify the synaptic targets to which A\u03b2Os attach. Methods: An unbiased approach using far western ligand blots has identified three synaptic proteins to which A\u03b2Os specifically attach. These proteins (p100, p140, and p260) were subsequently enriched by detergent extraction, ultracentrifugation, and CHT-HPLC column separation, and sequenced by LC-MS/MS. P100, p140, and p260 were identified. These levels of A\u03b2Os targets in human AD and aging frontal cortexes were analyzed by quantitative proteomics and western-blot. The polyclonal antibody to A\u03b2Os was developed and used to block the toxicity of A\u03b2Os. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. Results: A\u03b2Os binding proteins p100, p140, and p260 were identified as Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3, respectively. \u03b13-Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3 proteins showed loss in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of human AD frontal cortex. In short term experiments, oligomers of A\u03b2 inhibited Na/K-ATPase at the synapse. Na/K-ATPase activity was restored by an antibody specific for soluble forms of A\u03b2. \u03b13-Na/K-ATPase protein and synaptic \u03b2-amyloid peptides were pulled down from human AD synapses by co-immunoprecipitation. Results suggest synaptic dysfunction in early stages of AD may stem from inhibition of Na/K-ATPase activity by A\u03b2 oligomers, while later stages could hypothetically result from disrupted synapse structure involving the PSD proteins synGap and Shank3. Conclusion: We identified three A\u03b2O binding proteins as \u03b13-Na/K-ATPase, synGap, and Shank3. Soluble A\u03b2 oligomers appear capable of attacking neurons via specific extracellular as well as intracellular synaptic proteins.

Therefore, detection of the presence of A\u03b2 in AD brain tissue is a valuable tool for developing new treatments to prevent the progression of AD. Several classical amyloid binding dyes, fluorochrome, imaging probes, and A\u03b2-specific antibodies have been used to detect A\u03b2 histochemically in AD brain tissue. Use of these compounds for A\u03b2 detection is costly and time consuming. However, because of its intense fluorescent activity, high-affinity, and specificity for A\u03b2, as well as structural similarities with traditional amyloid binding dyes, curcumin (Cur) is a promising candidate for labeling and imaging of A\u03b2 plaques in postmortem brain tissue. It is a natural polyphenol from the herb Curcuma longa. In the present study, Cur was used to histochemically label A\u03b2 plaques from both a genetic mouse model of 5x familial Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD) and from human AD tissue within a minute. The labeling capability of Cur was compared to conventional amyloid binding dyes, such as thioflavin-S (Thio-S), Congo red (CR), and Fluoro-jade C (FJC), as well as A\u03b2-specific antibodies (6E10 and A11). We observed that Cur is the most inexpensive and quickest way to label and image A\u03b2 plaques when compared to these conventional dyes and is comparable to A\u03b2-specific antibodies. In addition, Cur binds with most A\u03b2 species, such as oligomers and fibrils.

In the visible platform trial, the swimming speed and escape latency of mice in different groups was not significantly different. In the hidden platform and reversal trials, the AD group showed a long escape latency. The escape latency decreased significantly after the MA treatment. Low platform crossover number and the proportion of time in the SW quadrant in the probe trial increased after the MA treatment (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01).

In this review, we describe and discuss recent evidence from human postmortem and clinical biomarker studies addressing the differential vulnerability of brain areas to tau pathology, its cell-to-cell transmission, and characteristics of the different strains that tau aggregates can adopt. Cellular biosensor assays are increasingly used in human tissue to detect the earliest forms of tau pathology, before overt histopathological lesions (i.e., neurofibrillary tangles) are apparent. Animal models with localized tau expression are used to uncover the mechanisms that influence spreading of tau aggregates. Further, studies of human postmortem-derived tau filaments from different tauopathies injected in rodents have led to striking findings that recapitulate neuropathology-based staging of tau.

Mounting evidence further substantiates an important role of the protease KLK8 in neuroplasticity. In the present study we sought to gain new mechanistic insights in the interplay between KLK8, neuroplasticity and tau phosphorylation in the context of AD. We here demonstrate that KLK8 inhibition increased the number of hippocampal Ki-67 and doublecortin positive, proliferative neuronal progenitor cells in transgenic mice, whereas the same action in wildtypes had no effect. In line with these results, KLK8 inhibition reduced the levels of its pro-proliferative interaction partners KLK6 and protease-activated receptor 2 only in wildtypes, while the levels of its proliferation-supporting substrate neuregulin-1 and the non-complexed form of its complexing-partner phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 were enhanced in both genotypes. Concomitant incubation of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2)-producing primary neurons with KLK8 and its inhibitory antibody increased neurite complexity and soma size. KLK8 inhibition in SH-SY5Y cells or in primary neurons increased levels of the neuroplasticity-supporting KLK8 substrate ephrin receptor B2 (EPHB2) and total tau while decreasing the relative amount of phospho-tau in relation to total tau. KLK8 blockade further enhanced cell proliferation in SH-SY5Y cells. Additional co-incubation with an inhibitory anti-EPHB2 antibody decreased total tau levels and neurite complexity and increased the ratio of phospho-tau/total tau, underlining the key role of EPHB2 on this plastic change. In a reverse in vitro approach, KLK8 induction reduced EPHB2 and total tau and increased the ratio of phospho-tau/total tau, leading to impaired proliferation and neuronal differentiation.

This chapter describes novel applications of community-based approaches to biobanking and biospecimen research areas to highlight (1) three critical steps for engaging Hispanic communities in cancer research, (2) best practices and scientifically based strategies and considerations for enhancing community engagement in research, and (3) lessons learned.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "34460191": {"ArticleTitle": "The Biology of Breast Cancer Disparities in Hispanics: Current Knowledge, Gaps, and Research Opportunities", "AbstractText": "Hispanic women have a lower incidence of breast cancer and a lower population-based mortality than non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. However, Hispanics with breast cancer are younger, have more advanced disease at presentation, and are more likely to have aggressive subtypes of breast cancers (triple negative and HER2 positive) than NHW. As a result, Hispanic women with breast cancer have a higher mortality than NHW. Data show that socioeconomic factors (low SES, lack of insurance, lack of access to care) are the most significant contributors to these disparities. The greatest disparities in outcomes and mortality exist among young breast cancer subsets. We hypothesize that low SES factors and associated increased stress and poor dietary habits lead to higher incidence of childhood obesity in Hispanics. Obesity leads to increased production of serum IL-6 and other adipokines, increasing aromatase transcription; this leads to increased serum estrogen and genotoxic estrogen metabolites, contributing to higher incidence of early onset breast cancer with its worse prognosis. Recent data support this hypothesis, showing that obesity in pre-pubertal girls leads to higher serum estradiol concentrations and higher levels of genotoxic estrogen metabolites. Epidemiological data show that prolonged exposure to hormonal contraceptives leads to higher breast cancer risk, supporting the idea that a potential factor in breast carcinogenesis and breast cancer disparities is a continuum of increased exposure to estrogen from early childhood to adulthood. Thus, focusing preventive breast cancer research interventions during childhood and early adulthood in low socioeconomic neighborhoods may significantly ameliorate breast cancer disparities in Hispanics.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "34460190": {"ArticleTitle": "The Need for a Holistic Approach to Prevent Reproductive Cancers Among US Latinas: The Potential Impact of Normalizing Sexuality and Improving Communication", "AbstractText": "US Latinas are disproportionately affected by health disparities, particularly in the domain of sexual and reproductive health.

Dr. Esteban L\u00f3pez from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas spoke about understanding drivers and barriers for Latinos in cancer care. To find strategies for culturally relevant care, Blue Cross is using both published and online research to gain knowledge about what health challenges Latinos face. Dr. Robert Croyle, from the National Cancer Institute, pointed out that health disparities research has moved from documenting what is wrong to raising aspirations and goals to what is possible. Still, Latinos are underrepresented in cancer clinical trials, and one barrier to Latino accrual is the use of comorbidities as exclusion criteria. Also, NCI validates its cancer statistics by linking cancer registry data to census data; so, to support cancer research, we must support a good census. Dr. Elena Rios, President and CEO of the National Hispanic Medical Association, gave a comprehensive presentation on cancer and Latino advocacy.

Breast cancer is a highly prevalent, molecularly heterogeneous group of malignancies that remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Much is known about the molecular landscape of breast cancers, their mutational and gene expression profiles. Molecular tests are widely used in the clinic to estimate breast cancer risk and its recurrence in patients treated for breast cancer. However, these tests are based on studies conducted in populations that at present include very small numbers of Latinas. As of December 2018, only 37 out of 3650 molecular profiles of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas are from women who reported Hispanic/Latina ethnicity, and no race or ethnicity information is associated with a majority of the cases (2735). Hence, the clinical usefulness of molecular breast cancer tests in Latinas of different ancestry admixtures remains to be established. Patients who are identified as Hispanic/Latino are characterized by highly variable ancestry admixtures, which makes genetic and gene\u2013environment interaction studies particularly challenging. Our group has investigated the molecular portraits of breast cancers in a cohort of Colombian women and identified a high prevalence of luminal B subtype tumors characterized by high expression of proliferation-related genes and other clinically relevant genes.

She describes the general features of well-designed biomarker-driven clinical trials and offers specific suggestions for designing clinical trials to support FDA approval. Perez predicts that in the near future, tumor sequencing will become standard clinical practice; liquid biopsies will become available to sample circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); tumor classification will become molecular-based, and tumor-agnostic biomarker strategies may be used to manage patients; and clinical trials in oncology will use sequencing at both enrollment and follow-up. Additionally, she describes some basic concepts and challenges in the use of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) biomarkers, which are revolutionizing oncology. A new Program for Accelerated Cancer Therapies (PACT) was cited as an example of a multidisciplinary collaboration with NIH, NCI, and biopharma that aims to support the development of standardized biomarkers for immunoprofiling and exploratory biomarkers of high relevance to patient care. Finally, Perez explains why bringing biomarker-based trials to patients is challenging and predicts that large collaboratives such as PACT will move precision medicine and oncology forward by linking clinical retrospective and prospective cancer genomic and proteomic data with longitudinal clinical outcomes.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "34426479": {"ArticleTitle": "Objective evaluation of nutritional status using the prognostic nutritional index during and after chemoradiotherapy in Japanese patients with head and neck cancer: a retrospective study.", "AbstractText": "The incidence of severe mucosal damage due to low nutritional status is high in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for head and neck cancer.

Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and perception of HCPs regarding ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance in a tertiary care teaching hospital in, Nepal. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. A questionnaire was distributed to 215 HCPs (medical doctors, nurses, and pharmacists) between March and September 2018. Knowledge and perception regarding ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance were studied. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). Results: The HCPs included 75 medical doctors, 126 nurses, and 14 pharmacists. Majority of the participants were female (67%), and the majority of participants were not aware of pharmacovigilance. Among the participants, pharmacists were found to have better knowledge regarding pharmacovigilance. However, other HCPs (doctors and nurses) strongly agreed about the necessity of having adequate knowledge about pharmacovigilance. Out of 215, 57.7% agreed that the important benefit of reporting ADR was to identify safe drugs and improve patient safety.

In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of CAB in guiding physicians to assess risk of cancer recurrence and to make informed treatment decisions for patients. Of more than 500 patients who have undergone CAB test, detailed analysis of 455 patients who were treated based on CAB-based risk predictions by more than 140 doctors across India is presented here. Majority of patients tested had node negative, T2, and grade 2 disease. Age and luminal subtypes did not affect the performance of CAB. On comparison with Adjuvant! Online (AOL), CAB categorized twice the number of patients into low risk indicating potential of overtreatment by AOL-based risk categorization. We assessed the impact of CAB testing on treatment decisions for 254 patients and observed that 92% low-risk patients were not given chemotherapy. Overall, we observed that 88% patients were either given or not given chemotherapy based on whether they were stratified as high risk or low risk for distant recurrence respectively.

For the Group 1 agents, there were cross-cutting questions about the relevance to humans of certain cancer sites or mechanistic pathways in animals. This publication is based on a systematic identification and comparison of the cancer sites observed in humans and those observed in experimental animals, and a compilation of mechanistic events for agents known to cause cancer in humans. Relevant information was analysed on all the agents classified in Group\u00a01 in\u00a0Monographs\u00a0up to and including Volume 109, most of which are reviewed in Volume 100A\u2013F. A database of tumour sites seen in humans and animals was used to examine the degree of concordance by use of an anatomically based tumour classification scheme. The analysis of mechanistic aspects of the IARC Group\u00a01 agents focused on 10 key characteristics of human carcinogens developed during the course of this work. Genotoxicity was the most prevalent mechanistic characteristic, consistent with the process of carcinogenesis necessarily involving genomic changes. The IARC concordance database represents a useful source of information for comparing animal and human data with respect to the tumours caused in different species. The results of the mechanistic analysis can provide a basis for future efforts to categorize mechanistic data for carcinogens through a systematic review process.

These fatty acids are precursors of longer chain fatty acids, arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3), and eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid, 20:3 n-9), respectively.8 AA and Mead acid have more proinflammatory properties than EPA.6 Prolonged use of SO emulsions in PN has been associated with hypertriglyceridemia, proinflammatory profile, and PNALD.5,6 As a result, different lipid formulations have been developed. For instance, olive oil (OO) has been added to reduce the amount of SO in lipid emulsions for PN.9 OO is the main source of lipid in the Mediterranean diet, consisting of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (18:1 n-9), phenolic compounds, and squalene.10 Diets enriched with OO have been linked to health benefits such as prevention of cancer, heart disease, and aging through its antioxidant properties.10 Compared with pure SO emulsion in PN, a mixture of 80% OO/20% SO has been shown to have some clinical benefits, despite the concern about the increase in Mead acid levels in OO enriched lipid emulsions.6 Another lipid has been used to reduce the level SO component in lipid emulsions for PN was medium chain triglycerides (MCT), containing fatty acids of 6 to 12 carbon atoms.11 Unlike long chain triglycerides (LCT) with fatty acid chains ranging from 14 to 21 carbon atoms, MCT are more water soluble and readily oxidized in the mitochondria for the production of energy.11 A mixture of 50% MCT/50% LCT has been developed and considered to be safe and tolerable in patients requiring PN.12 However, the beneficial effects of MCT/LCT compared with other lipid emulsions for PN remains unclear.6 Fish oil (FO) has lately been considered as an ideal choice of lipid to partially or completely replace SO.6 FO has a high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (20% to 40%), particularly EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3),13 which have been shown to reduce inflammation by competing with AA for eicosanoid synthesis, producing the 3-series of prostaglandins and thromboxanes and the 5-series of leukotrienes.6 Mixed-oil containing FO for use in PN such as SO/MCT/OO/FO (30%/30%/25%/15%) or MCT/SO/FO (50%/40%/10%) has been recently developed and is available for PN use.6 From small-scale clinical trials, fish oil enriched PN appears to have some clinical benefits compared with non-fish oil enriched PN.4,14 In a recent CADTH report,15 published in 2017, entitled \u201cLipid Formulations for Patients Requiring Parenteral Nutrition: A Review of Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness and Guidelines\u201d, low quality evidence found no difference in comparative clinical effectiveness among lipid emulsions examined in preterm infants. There was some evidence that fish oil enriched PN had some clinical benefits in non-surgical and surgical adult patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Economic evaluations from low-quality studies showed that FO emulsion was more cost-effective than SO-based emulsions. None of the identified guidelines could make strong recommendations regarding the type of lipid emulsions for PN due to insufficient evidence.

A minimal dose level is heavily dependent on the image reconstruction algorithms and clinical task, in which the tissue texture always plays an important role. This study aims to investigate the dependence through a task-based evaluation at multiple dose levels and variable textures in reconstructions with prospective patient studies. 133 patients with a suspicious pulmonary nodule scheduled for biopsy were recruited and the data was acquired at120kVp with three different dose levels of 100, 40 and 20mAs. Three reconstruction algorithms were implemented: analytical filtered back-projection (FBP) with optimal noise filtering; statistical Markov random field (MRF) model with optimal Huber weighting (MRF-H) for piecewise smooth reconstruction; and tissue-specific texture model (MRF-T) for texture preserved statistical reconstruction. Experienced thoracic radiologists reviewed and scored all images at random, blind to the CT dose and reconstruction algorithms. The radiologists identified the nodules in each image including the 133 biopsy target nodules and 66 other non-target nodules. For target nodule characterization, only MRF-T at 40mAs showed no statistically significant difference from FBP at 100mAs. For localizing both the target nodules and the non-target nodules, some as small as 3mm, MRF-T at 40 and 20mAs levels showed no statistically significant difference from FBP at 100mAs, respectively. MRF-H and FBP at 40 and 20mAs levels performed statistically differently from FBP at 100mAs. This investigation concluded that (1) the textures in the MRF-T reconstructions improves both the tasks of localizing and characterizing nodules at low dose CT and (2) the task of characterizing nodules is more challenging than the task of localizing nodules and needs more dose or enhanced textures from reconstruction.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "33899924": {"ArticleTitle": "[Corrigendum] ANXA1\u2011derived peptides suppress gastric and colon cancer cell growth by targeting EphA2 degradation.", "AbstractText": "Following the publication of the above article, the authors have realized that one of the data panels featured in Fig.\u00a05D was selected incorrectly.

Our gene expression profiling and molecular characterization revealed that Snail actively suppressed the expression of glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), a key enzyme on the serine/glycine metabolic shunt, through binding to an evolutionarily conserved E-box motif and thereby inhibiting the promoter of the GLDC gene. Besides, knockdown of GLDC led to a cellular function shift from proliferation to migration.This study has revealed a novel molecular link that integrates the serine/glycine metabolism with the Snail-mediated EMT program in cancer cells.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "33867720": {"ArticleTitle": "Emerging Roles of Salivary lncRNAome in Oral Cancer.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "33867704": {"ArticleTitle": "Amelioration of Combination of Paclitaxel and Di Allyl Sulfide on the Alterations of Bcl2, P53 and Apoptosis Changes Against 7,12 Di Methyl Benz (A) Anthracene Induced Skin Cancer in Experimental Animals.", "AbstractText": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the Bcl2, P53 and apoptosis changes against skin cancer in experimental animals.

Historically, pegfilgrastim has been administered 24 to 72 hours after chemotherapy, necessitating a return to clinic to receive the provider-administered injection. An alternative option is the pegfilgrastim on-body injector (OBI). With the OBI device, patients have their pegfilgrastim administered 27 hours after receiving chemotherapy while remaining at home, avoiding an additional clinic appointment. Concerns with pegfilgrastim OBI include lack of experience with the device in both the patient and provider, device-related failures, and the success of delivery. This study evaluates pegfilgrastim OBI failure rates through associated patient outcomes among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy requiring G-CSF. Methods: A retrospective electronic chart review was conducted of adult patients with cancer who received chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim OBI from July 1, 2016, to July 31, 2018. The primary objective of this study was the incidence of FN in patients receiving pegfilgrastim OBI. Results: There were no reported cases of hospitalization due to FN in patients who received pegfilgrastim OBI. Dose delays and dosage modifications were not observed in our review. The OBI device failure rate was found to be low (1.92%). Conclusion: The low device failure rate from this study suggests that the OBI is a viable option for administration of pegfilgrastim in patients receiving chemotherapy requiring G-CSF.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "33777636": {"ArticleTitle": "Trends in the Management Paradigms of Intracranial Meningioma.", "AbstractText": "Objective \u2003Intracranial meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor.

Here, we describe the trends of management of intracranial meningiomas using a national database. Methods \u2003The data were obtained from the National Cancer Database for the years 2004 to 2015, the collected variables included: patients' age, gender, insurance type, income, comorbidity score, the tumor size and grade, and treatment modality (observation, surgery, radiotherapy, or combination therapy). We performed statistical analyses to detect association between unique variables and outcomes. In addition, we performed mortality analyses for various treatment modalities. Results \u2003A total of 199,096 patients with a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma were included, the majority of patients were white females, mean age of 61 years, and half of the tumors were \u2264 3\u2009cm. Observation was the most commonly used management modality followed by surgical resection, radiotherapy, and combination therapy. For the entire time period, there was an increased use of observation as a primary management method. Predictors of mortality included increased age, larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, treatment at a community hospital, and higher comorbidity scores. Conclusion \u2003Population-based studies of intracranial meningiomas are uncommon; our study is one of the few reports that examine the changes in the modern management paradigms of meningioma in the United States over time.

A THz image can be represented by a data cube with each pixel containing a high dimension spectrum vector covering several THz frequencies, where each frequency represents a different dimension in the vector. The proposed algorithm projects the high-dimension spectrum vector of each pixel within the THz image into a low-dimension subspace that contains the majority of the unique features embedded in the image. The low-dimension subspace is constructed by sequentially identifying its orthonormal basis vectors, such that each newly chosen basis vector represents the most unique information not contained by existing basis vectors. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to represent the statistical distributions of the low-dimension feature vectors obtained from the proposed dimension reduction algorithm. The model parameters are iteratively learned by using unsupervised learning methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or expectation maximization, and the results are used to classify the various regions within a tumor sample. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves apparent performance improvement in human breast cancer tissue over existing approaches such as one-dimension Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Furthermore, the dogs spent no less time in front of the speakers projecting the rattles than they did in front of speakers projecting control sounds or no sound. The dogs' reactions may not be representative of other species with whom rattlesnakes come into contact, but the data suggest a need for some circumspection about the role of rattling in the rattlesnake's defensive repertoire.

alignment play important roles in tissue morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer metastasis. How cells sense the direction and position in these processes, however, has not been fully understood. Here we construct a theoretical model based on describing cell layer as a nemato-elastic medium, by which the cell polarization, cell alignment and cell active contraction are explicitly expressed as functions of components of the nematic order parameter. To determine the order parameter we derive two sets of governing equations, one for the force equilibrium of the system, and the other for the minimization of the system's free energy including the energy of cell polarization and alignment. By solving these coupled governing equations, we can predict the effects of substrate stiffness, geometries of cell layers, external forces and myosin activity on the direction- and position-dependent cell aspect ratio and cell orientation. Moreover, the axisymmetric problem with cells on a ring-like pattern is solved analytically, and the analytical solution for cell aspect ratio are governed by parameter groups which include the stiffness of the cell and the substrate, the strength of myosin activity and the external forces. Our predictions of the cell aspect ratio and orientation are generally comparable to experimental observations. These results show that the pattern of cell polarization is determined by the anisotropic degree of active contractile stress, and suggest a stress-driven polarization mechanism that enables cells to sense their spatial positions to develop direction- and position-dependent behavior. This, in turn, sheds light on the ways to control pattern formation in tissue engineering for potential biomedical applications.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "33505620": {"ArticleTitle": "Bibliometric analysis of the top-100 cited articles on oral potentially malignant disorders to guide research topic and direction.", "AbstractText": "Bibliometric analysis highlights the key topics and studies which have shaped the understanding and management of a concerned disease.

In cfDNA samples, the prevalence of wild type EGFR was 48% while the prevalence of TKI resistant and TKI sensitive mutations were 3%. Conversely, in tissue DNA samples, the prevalence of wild type, TKI sensitive and TKI resistant mutations were 48%, 19%, and 3%, respectively. The overall concordance of EGFR mutation between cfDNA and tissue DNA was 83%.

A sheath around the variable stiffness structure delivers a series of force transmission cables that connect to two independent tubular end-effectors through which standard flexible endoscopic instruments can pass and be anchored.

Thus, we report a novel concept of a theranostic nanoparticle (NP) consisting of an amphiphilic near-infrared (NIR) dye as a hydrophilic drug delivery carrier with enhanced NIR imaging capability. Unlike conventional nanocarrier systems, the newly designed amphiphilic NIR dyes (Cy-C dyes) function as both the drug delivery carrier and the fluorescent imaging agent. It can be utilized for therapy and diagnosis simultaneously by simply encapsulating the hydrophilic drug. This method is innovative not only due to formation of the theranostic nanoparticle for immiscible hydrophilic drug delivery but also because of generation of strong fluorescence signals due to the Cy-C dyes on the surfaces of the NPs.

The SPBANPs themselves exhibited remarkable inhibition of cancer cell proliferation (B16F10, A549, MCF-7, and SK-OV-3) in vitro. Substantial inhibition of melanoma tumor growth was observed in the C57BL6/J mouse model (aggressive murine melanoma model: B16F10) after intraperitoneal administration of the SPBANPs without any anticancer drug. Additionally, the SPBANPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity in various Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Interestingly, this nanoformulation itself works as a drug delivery vehicle, as well as an anticancer and antibacterial agent.

Conventional treatment approaches (e.g., radiation or chemotherapy) treat both cancerous and surrounding normal tissues simultaneously, which leads to a poor therapeutic effect on tumors and severe toxic side effects on healthy tissues. Considering these thematic issues, the design and development of more efficient treatment approaches is one of the most important demands of health care in the near future. In this context, the emergence of nanotechnology opens new opportunities for addressing the issues of conventional drug delivery systems (DDSs) for cancer therapy. Theranostic nanomedicines are indebted to the advent of nanotechnology and were introduced by Funkhouser in 2002. These nanomedicines are the newest DDSs that combine diagnostic and therapeutic properties into a single platform. Theranostic nanomedicines are generally composed of targeting agents, diagnostic tracers, effective drug(s), and biomaterial(s) as the matrix to the formulation. Among these, biomaterials have a pivotal role in theranostic nanomedicines due to their direct influence on the system effectiveness. In this context, natural polymers can be considered as potential candidates, mainly due to their inherent physicochemical as well as biological advantages. However, natural polymers have some drawbacks, which can be addressed through the chemical modification approach.

While routine screening with Pap smear testing has reduced the burden of cervical cancer in the high-income countries, the implementation of organised Pap-based screening programmes has not been found feasible in low-resource settings due to a lack of health care delivery infrastructure and limited health budgets. The well-established causal relationship between cervical cancer development and high-risk-HPV (HR-HPV) infection and the subsequent appreciation of the greater sensitivity of HPV testing over Pap smear cytology eventually lead to HPV testing being incorporated in the primary cervical cancer prevention programmes. An organised cervical cancer screening programme incorporating HR-HPV testing and HPV vaccine administration are currently considered to be the two major interventions for a comprehensive cervical cancer control programme worldwide. However, there are concerns that the requirement of a sophisticated infrastructure with its associated costs may make cervical cancer screening using molecular prevention by HPV testing impracticable to be implemented, especially in resource-poor, low-income countries.

We previously found that the disulfide bond-linkage demonstrates surprising oxidation-sensitivity to form the hydrophilic sulfoxide and sulphone groups. Herein, we develop oxidation-strengthened prodrug nanosystem loaded with pyropheophorbide a (PPa) to achieve light-activatable cascade drug release and enhance therapeutic efficacy. The disulfide bond-driven prodrug nanosystems not only respond to the redox-heterogeneity in tumor, but also respond to the exogenous oxidant (singlet oxygen) elicited by photosensitizers. Once the prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) are activated under irradiation, they would undergo an oxidative self-strengthened process, resulting in a facilitated drug cascade release. The IC50 value of the PPa@PTX-S-S NPs without irradiation was 2-fold higher than those of NPs plus irradiation. In vivo, the PPa@PTX prodrug NPs display prolonged systemic circulation and increased accumulation in tumor site. The PPa@PTX-S-S NPs showed much higher efficiency than free PTX or the PPa@PTX-C-C NPs to suppress the growth of 4T1 tumors.

What is the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancreatic adenocarcinoma? 3. What are the harms of screening for pancreatic adenocarcinoma? 4. Does treatment of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma improve cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, or quality of life? 5. What are the harms of treatment of screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma?We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and PubMed, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews.

We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), for relevant ongoing studies.We reviewed 19,596 abstracts and 824 articles against specified inclusion criteria. Eligible studies included those written in English and conducted in adults age 18 years or older with or without risk factors for pancreatic cancer. For key questions on screening, we included imaging-based screening protocols. For key questions on treatment, we included studies of adults with screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.We conducted dual, independent critical appraisal of all provisionally included studies and abstracted study details and results from fair- and good-quality studies. Because of the limited number of studies and the population heterogeneity, we provided a narrative synthesis of results and used summary tables to allow for comparisons across studies. After confirming that the yield of different imaging modalities was similar across studies, we calculated a pooled diagnostic yield across studies and produced forest plots to illustrate the range of effects seen across studies. For harms of screening (KQ3) and harms of treatment (KQ5), we stratified results by procedural and psychosocial harms.We included 13 unique prospective cohort screening studies (24 articles) reporting results for 1,317 people. Studies were conducted in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and all screening populations except one small comparison group were exclusively in persons at elevated familial or genetic risk for pancreatic cancer. No studies reported on the effect of screening for pancreatic adenocarcinoma on cancer morbidity, mortality, or all-cause mortality (KQ1); and no studies reported on the effectiveness of treatment for screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KQ4). Thirteen fair quality studies reported on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KQ2). Across these studies, 18 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were detected.. Twelve of 18 cases (66.7%) were detected at stage I or II or classified as \u201cresectable.\u201d Pooled yield for all screening tests to detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma on initial screening in high-risk populations was 7.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 3.6 to 14.7); and for total yield including both initial and repeat screening, it was 15.6 per 1000 (95% CI, 9.3 to 24.5). Harms of screening for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Procedural harms of screening were evaluated in eight screening studies (n=675); psychological harms were assessed in two studies (n=277). Details on the assessment of harms were variably reported. In two studies (n=277) in which 150 individuals received ERCP as a diagnostic followup test, 15 people (10%) reported acute pancreatitis, nine of which required hospitalization. No evidence of increased worry, distress, depression, or anxiety after screening was reported, compared to before screening. Harms of treatment of screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma Of the 57 people who underwent surgery across all studies, six studies (n=32 people receiving surgery) assessed harms of treatment of screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (KQ5), with 7 harms detected in two studies. Methods of assessing harms were variably reported. Harms included one person experiencing stricture to the hepaticojejunal anastomosis at 11 months after surgery, one with unspecified post-operative complications, 2 with post-operative fistula and 3 cases of diabetes. In the two studies that systematically assessed harms in all surgical patients (n=12 people receiving surgery), no harms were reported.No randomized trials of screening were identified. The body of evidence includes observational screening studies with limited sample sizes and focused on populations with known familial risk, many with a substantial proportion of people with known genetic mutations. No studies included a clinical followup or unscreened comparison group, limiting assessment of diagnostic accuracy. Of those studies that reported harms of screening or treatment, limitations included inadequate description of the methods of assessing harms, including whether all participants were systematically assessed.Imaging-based screening in groups at high familial risk can detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma with limited evidence of minimal harms.

Conjugating GEM with d-\u03b1-tocopherol succinate (TOS) is an effective solution, while the GEM-TOS (GT) is unstable in aqueous solution. d-\u03b1-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) has been used to enhance the stability, but GT stabilized by TPGS (GTT) has limited effect on tumor metastases. Tumor metastases lead to high mortality in patients suffering from cancers. In order to further achieve antimetastatic effect, an amphiphilic polymer (LT) was synthesized by connecting low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) with TOS, and eventually obtained desired self-delivery micellar NPs (GLT) by co-assembly GT with LT. The GLT not only possessed excellent stability, but also inhibited the metastases by acting on different phases of the metastatic cascade. The hydrophobic TOS inhibited the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), the hydrophilic LMWH inhibited the interaction between tumor cells and platelets.

Two of the most advanced systems are BrainLAB Multiple Metastases Elements (MME), a dynamic conformal arc (DCA) approach, and Varian RapidArc (RA), a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) approach. In this work, we systematically compared plan quality between the 2 techniques.Thirty patients with 4 to 10 metastases (217 total; median 7.5; Vmin = 0.014 cm3; Vmax = 17.73 cm3) were planned with both Varian RA and MME at 2 different institutions with extensive experience in each respective technique. All plans had a single isocenter and used Varian linac equipped with high-definition multileaf collimator. RA plans used 2 to 4 noncoplanar VMAT arcs with 10 MV flattening filter-free beam. MME plans used 4 to 9 noncoplanar DCAs and 6 MV flattening filter-free beam, (minimum planning target volume [PTVmin] = 0.49 cm3; PTVmax = 27.32 cm3; PTVmedian = 7.05 cm3).

Treatment-specific risk factors, such as the use of chemotherapy and surgery, are clinically relevant when evaluating radiation therapy planning criteria. A risk-adjusted control chart was developed to identify unusual plan quality after accounting for patient- and treatment-specific risk factors. In this proof of concept, 6 OAR DVH points and average monitor units serve as proxies for plan quality. Eighteen risk factors are considered for modeling quality: planning target volume (PTV) and OAR cross-sectional areas; volumes, spreads, and surface areas; minimum and centroid distances between OARs and the PTV; 6 PTV DVH points; use of chemotherapy; and surgery. A total of 69 head and neck cases were used to demonstrate the application of risk-adjusted control charts, and the results were compared with the application of conventional control charts.The risk-adjusted control chart remains robust to interpatient variations in the studied risk factors, unlike the conventional control chart. For the brainstem, the conventional chart signaled 4 patients with unusual (out-of-control) doses to 2% brainstem volume. However, the adjusted chart did not signal any plans after accounting for their risk factors. For the spinal cord doses to 2% brainstem volume, the conventional chart signaled 2 patients, and the adjusted chart signaled a separate patient after accounting for their risk factors.

Previously, we found that SMI synergistically enhanced the activity of chemotherapy on colorectal cancer by promoting the distribution of drugs in xenograft tumors. However, the underlying mechanisms and bioactive constituents remained unknown. In the present work, the regulatory effects of SMI on tumor vasculature were determined, and the potential anti-angiogenic components targeting tumor endothelial cells (TECs) were identified. Multidimensional pharmacokinetic profiles of ginsenosides in plasma, subcutaneous tumors, and TECs were investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of protopanaxadiol-type (PPD) ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2/Rb3, Rc, and Rd) in both plasma and tumors, were higher than those of protopanaxatriol-type (Rg1 and Re) and oleanane-type (Ro) ginsenosides. Among PPD-type ginsenosides, Rd exhibited the greatest concentrations in tumors and TECs after repeated injection. In\u00a0vivo bioactivity results showed that Rd suppressed neovascularization in tumors, normalized the structure of tumor vessels, and improved the anti-tumor effect of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in xenograft mice.

Phototherapies mainly rely on manipulation of target tissue through photothermal, photochemical, or photomechanical interactions. Combining phototherapy with immunotherapy has the benefit of eliciting a systemic immune response. Specifically, photothermal therapy (PTT) has been shown to induce apoptosis and necrosis in cancer cells, releasing tumor associated antigenic peptides while sparing healthy host cells, through temperature increase in targeted tissue. However, the tissue temperature must be monitored and controlled to minimize adverse thermal effects on normal tissue and to avoid the destruction of tumor-specific antigens, in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effects of PTT. Techniques for monitoring PTT have evolved from post-treatment quantification methods like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry to modern methods capable of real-time monitoring, such as magnetic resonance thermometry, computed tomography, and photoacoustic imaging. Monitoring methods are largely chosen based on the type of light delivery to the target tissue. Interstitial methods of thermometry, such as thermocouples and fiber-optic sensors, are able to monitor temperature of the local tumor environment. However, these methods can be challenging if the phototherapy itself is interstitially administered. Increasingly, non-invasive therapies call for non-invasive monitoring, which can be achieved through magnetic resonance thermometry, computed tomography, and photoacoustic imaging techniques. The purpose of this review is to introduce the feasible methods used to monitor tissue temperature during PTT.

However, these methods are not flexible enough to handle aberrant patterns of gene expression data, e.g., inconsistent cell type-specific gene expression between purified reference samples and tumor samples. We propose a novel statistical method for expression deconvolution called ICeD-T (Immune Cell Deconvolution in Tumor tissues). ICeD-T automatically identifies aberrant genes whose expression are inconsistent with the deconvolution model and down-weights their contributions to cell type abundance estimates. We evaluated the performance of ICeD-T versus existing methods in simulation studies and several real data analyses. ICeD-T displayed comparable or superior performance to these competing methods. Applying these methods to assess the relationship between immunotherapy response and immune cell composition, ICeD-T is able to identify significant associations that are missed by its competitors.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "33012498": {"ArticleTitle": "Bone metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma simulating a pulmonary origin.

The rationale for the present study was to analyze the value of stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) for complete removal of DCIS, focusing on the relationship between the absence of residual microcalcifications after stereotactic VAB and the histopathological diagnosis of the definitive surgical specimen.Data of 58 consecutive patients diagnosed with DCIS by stereotactic VAB in a single breast center between 2012 and 2017 were analyzed. Patient records from the hospital information system were retrieved, and mammogram reports and images as well as histopathology reports were evaluated.

Upstaging to invasive cancer was recorded in 4 cases (13%) but occurred only in the group that had high-grade DCIS on biopsy. Low-grade DCIS was never upgraded to high-grade DCIS in the definitive specimen.The radiological absence of microcalcifications after stereotactic biopsy does not rule out residual DCIS in the final surgical specimen.

In this paper, we present methods to model the entire marginal distribution of pixel intensities via the quantile function as functional data, regressed on a set of demographic, clinical, and genetic predictors to investigate their effects of imaging-based cancer heterogeneity. We call this approach quantile functional regression, regressing subject-specific marginal distributions across repeated measurements on a set of covariates, allowing us to assess which covariates are associated with the distribution in a global sense, as well as to identify distributional features characterizing these differences, including mean, variance, skewness, heavy-tailedness, and various upper and lower quantiles. To account for smoothness in the quantile functions, account for intrafunctional correlation, and gain statistical power, we introduce custom basis functions we call quantlets that are sparse, regularized, near-lossless, and empirically defined, adapting to the features of a given data set and containing a Gaussian subspace so non-Gaussianness can be assessed. We fit this model using a Bayesian framework that uses nonlinear shrinkage of quantlet coefficients to regularize the functional regression coefficients and provides fully Bayesian inference after fitting a Markov chain Monte Carlo.

It is known that co-segmentation methods utilizing the complementary information between PET and CT can improve segmentation accuracy.

In this study, we proposed a novel variational method for tumor co-segmentation in PET/CT, with a fusion strategy specifically designed to handle the information inconsistency between PET and CT in an adaptive way - the method can automatically decide which modality should be more trustful when PET and CT disagree to each other for localizing the tumor boundary. The proposed method was constructed based on the \u0393-convergence approximation of the Mumford-Shah (MS) segmentation model. A PET restoration process was integrated into the co-segmentation process, which further eliminate the uncertainty for tumor segmentation introduced by the blurring of tumor edges in PET.

Although survival from any pediatric cancer has improved dramatically during past decades, a number of cancers continue to yield dismal prognoses, which has motivated the continued study of novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, even patients cured of pediatric cancer often experience severe adverse effects of treatment and other long-term health implications, such as cardiotoxicity or loss of fertility. For these patients, improved risk stratification to identify those who could safely receive alternate or less-intensive therapy without affecting prognosis is a key objective. Fortunately, pediatric cancers are rare overall, but even among patients with the same narrow cancer type, there is often broad heterogeneity in terms of prognosis, molecular features or pathology, current treatment strategies, and scientific objectives. As a result, the design of clinical trials in the pediatric cancer setting is challenged by a number of practical issues that must be addressed to ensure trial feasibility for this vulnerable group of patients. In this review, we discuss some of the unique trial design considerations often encountered in any rare tumor setting through the lens of our experiences as faculty statisticians for the Children's Oncology Group, the largest organization in the world dedicated exclusively to pediatric cancer research and clinical trials. These topics include risk stratification within individual trials, relaxation of trial operating characteristics and parameters, use of historical controls, and address of noninferiority-type objectives in small cohorts.

In addition, the cost and time exerted for genomic profiling needs to be balanced with expectations of benefit for each patient. This article summarizes the effort to implement precision oncology in Japan. The most promising development is that tests to profile the genomes of select cancers are now fully covered by the national health insurance system. In May 2019, two gene panels were approved with reimbursement: FoundationOne CDx Cancer Genomic Profile and OncoGuide NCC Oncopanel System, the latter of which was developed in Japan. To make better use of scarce resources, the reimbursement is restricted to patients with solid tumors that have progressed on standard chemotherapy, rare tumors, or tumors of unknown primary. To centralize Japanese precision oncology, the government designated approximately 170 hospitals and stratified them to three layers on the basis of their roles. In addition, Japan's National Cancer Center launched a Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) that collects genomic information and clinical characteristics of patients who received genomic profiling tests. C-CAT is expected to be the central data repository, to match patients with clinical trials, and to assist translational research. The centralized system under the national health insurance system could be a double-edged sword. Although tight regulation may make it hard to keep up with the rapid development of precision oncology, a federated ecosystem for sharing clinical and genomic data will be a precious asset and allow for shared access to data.

If there is strong evidence that the treatment is likely to be more beneficial in the biomarker-positive patients but a meaningful benefit is also possible in the biomarker-negative patients, then a properly powered biomarker-stratified design (eg, a subgroup-specific or Marker Sequential Test strategy) would provide the most rigorous determination of the sensitive populations.

For patients with aBRAF mCRC, median OS was 36.1 months, without a difference between classes, and median OS was 21.0 months for patients with BRAF mCRC. In contrast to right-sided predominance of tumors with BRAF mutation, 53% of patients with aBRAF mCRC had left-sided primary tumors. Concurrent RAS mutations were noted in 33% of patients with aBRAF mCRC, and 67% of patients had microsatellite stable disease. Among patients with aBRAF RAS wild-type mCRC who received anti-EGFR antibodies (monotherapy, n = 1; combination therapy, n = 10), no responses to anti-EGFR therapy were reported, and six patients (four with class III aBRAF mutations, one with class II, and one unclassified) achieved stable disease as best response.

SPR determination of IL8 with the immobilized antibody revealed high affinity (KD, 82.2 nM). Epitope identification of IL-8 was obtained by proteolytic epitope-extraction mass spectrometry of the peptide fragments upon high pressure trypsin digestion, using an affinity microcolumn with immobilized anti-IL-8 antibody. MALDI-MS of the affinity-bound peptide elution fraction revealed an assembled (discontinuous) epitope comprising two specific peptides, IL8 [12-20] and IL8 [55-60]. Identical epitope peptides were identified by direct MALDI-MS of the eluted epitope fraction from the immobilized anti-IL8 antibody on the SPR chip. SPR determination of the synthetic epitope peptides provided high affinities confirming their binding specificity.

Current approaches to quantify DUB activity are limited to test tube-based assays that incorporate enzymes or cell lysates, but not intact cells. The goal of this work was to develop a novel peptide-based biosensor of DUB activity that is cell permeable, protease-resilient, fluorescent, and specific to DUBs. The biosensor consists of an N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin motif that acts as both a 'protectide' to increase intracellular stability and a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) to facilitate the uptake into intact cells. The \u03b2-hairpin was conjugated to a C-terminal substrate consisting of the last four amino acids in ubiquitin (LRGG) to facilitate DUB mediated cleavage of a C-terminal fluorophore (AFC). The kinetics of the peptide reporter were characterized in cell lysates by dose response and inhibition enzymology studies. Inhibition studies with an established DUB inhibitor (PR-619) confirmed the specificity of both reporters to DUBs. Fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy experiments followed by mathematical modeling established the capability of the biosensor to measure DUB activity in intact cells while maintaining cellular integrity.

The ability to quantify these tractions is important in understanding and manipulating these processes. Three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3DTFM) provides reliable means of evaluating cellular tractions by first measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads in response to these tractions in the surrounding matrix, and then using this measurement to compute the tractions. However, most applications of 3DTFM assume that the surrounding extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is non-fibrous, despite the fact that in many natural and synthetic environments the ECM contains a significant proportion of fibrous components. Motivated by this, we develop a computational approach for determining tractions, while accounting for the fibrous nature of the ECM. In particular, we make use of a fiber-based constitutive model in which the stress contains contributions from a distribution of nonlinear elastic fibers and a hyperelastic matrix. We solve an inverse problem with the nodal values of the traction vector as unknowns, and minimize the difference between a predicted displacement field, obtained by solving the equations of equilibrium in conjunction with the fiber-based constitutive model, and the measured displacement field at the bead locations. We employ a gradient-based minimization method to solve this problem and determine the gradient efficiently by solving for the appropriate adjoint field. We apply this algorithm to problems with experimentally observed cell geometries and synthetic, albeit realistic, traction fields to gauge its sensitivity to noise, and quantify the impact of using an incorrect constitutive model: the so-called model error. We conclude that the approach is robust to noise, yielding about 10% error in tractions for 5% displacement noise. We also conclude that the impact of model error is significant, where using a nonlinear exponential hyperelastic model instead of the fiber-based model, can lead to more than 100% error in the traction field.

The purpose of this review is to provide the checklist of statistical analysis and methods in biomedical research (SAMBR) to applied researchers.We initially identified the important steps of reporting design features that may influence the choice of statistical analysis in biomedical research and essential steps of data analysis of common studies.

Part (C) of SAMBR can be used to perform essential and preferred evidence-based data analysis specific to study design and objective.We believe that the statistical methods checklists may improve reporting of research design, standardize methodological practices, and promote consistent application of statistical approaches, thus improving the quality of research studies.

In addition, a synchronous bilateral appearance is extremely rare with a quantity of only 1.6% of all UTUCs. Since an oncologically-safe treatment would be a radical nephroureterectomy, consequently leading to dialysis, a satisfying therapy is challenging.  We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with bilateral UTUCs at primary diagnosis and the sincere wish of a kidney-preserving treatment option. Therefore, multiple endoscopic ablations with a laser were performed, until a tumor-free status could be achieved. Owing to her medical history with a gynecologic tumor, a genetic examination was initiated, revealing the diagnosis of a Lynch syndrome. Based on promising results in the first 3-month follow-up we decided on a short-term endoscopic follow-up to keep control of tumor progression by endoscopic ablations when needed. In this way we are trying to spare our patient the dialysis.  An oncologically satisfying treatment for bilateral UTUCs stays a challenging problem in urology. Despite little available data and expected high recurrence rates, we decided on an endoscopic kidney-preserving therapy approach to eventually spare our patient the dialysis. Up to now we are pleasantly surprised about the result and since a short-term follow-up is possible in our department, we hope to attain endoscopic control of the tumor. In addition, we want to point out that genetic background might be underestimated and should be keep it in mind for special cases.

How to rationally fuse the complementary information in PET/CT for accurate tumor segmentation is challenging. In this study, a novel deep learning based variational method was proposed to automatically fuse multimodality information for tumor segmentation in PET/CT. A 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) was first designed and trained to produce a probability map from the CT image. The learnt probability map describes the probability of each CT voxel belonging to the tumor or the background, and roughly distinguishes the tumor from its surrounding soft tissues. A fuzzy variational model was then proposed to incorporate the probability map and the PET intensity image for an accurate multimodality tumor segmentation, where the probability map acted as a membership degree prior. A split Bregman algorithm was used to minimize the variational model. The proposed method was validated on a non-small cell lung cancer dataset with 84 PET/CT images. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1). Only a few training samples were needed for training the designed network to produce the probability map; 2). The proposed method can be applied to small datasets, normally seen in clinic research; 3). The proposed method successfully fused the complementary information in PET/CT, and outperformed two existing deep learning-based multimodality segmentation methods and other multimodality segmentation methods using traditional fusion strategies (without deep learning); 4). The proposed method had a good performance for tumor segmentation, even for those with Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake inhomogeneity and blurred tumor edges (two major challenges in PET single modality segmentation) and complex surrounding soft tissues (one major challenge in CT single modality segmentation), and achieved an average dice similarity indexes (DSI) of 0.86 \u00b1 0.05, sensitivity (SE) of 0.86 \u00b1 0.07, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.87 \u00b1 0.10, volume error (VE) of 0.16 \u00b1 0.12, and classification error (CE) of 0.30 \u00b1 0.12.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32773922": {"ArticleTitle": "Synthetic data method to incorporate external information into a current study.", "AbstractText": "We consider the situation where there is a known regression model that can be used to predict an outcome, Y, from a set of predictor variables X.

Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) has a major role in the outgrowth of metastatic breast cancer. Interleukin 18 (IL18) plays a role in macrophage alteration, which leads to excessive angiogenesis. This study aims to elaborate on the association of CCL2, IL18, IL23\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) expression with the anti-proliferative effect of ECCT in rat breast tumor tissue. \u00a0 Methods: Low intensity (18 Vpp) and intermediate frequency (150 kHz) alternating current-electric field (AC-EF) between two capacitive electrodes were exposed as external EF to a rat cage. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups of six replicates. Breast tumor tissues were collected from 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rats. Two groups were non DMBA-induced rats without ECCT exposure (NINT) and with (NIT). The other two groups were DMBA-induced rats without ECCT exposure (INT) and with (IT). Mammary glands and breast tumor tissues were collected from each group and preserved. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining were performed on paraffin sections of tissues using anti-PCNA, anti-ErbB2, anti-Caspase3, and anti-CD68. CCL2, IL18, IL23\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA relative expressions were analyzed using qRT-PCR. Results: ECCT exposure may cause the reduction of PCNA protein expression as well as ErbB2 on breast tumor tissues, but it causes the increase of Caspase3 and macrophage CD68 protein. In rat breast tumor tissues of IT groups, the mRNA expression of CCL2 and IL18 are significantly down-regulated, in contrast with the up-regulated expression of these cytokines in tumor tissues of the INT group. IL23\u03b1 and TNF- \u03b1 expression remained similar in both groups.

With modern lifespan the postmenopausal attenuation of circulating estrogen levels can negatively impact a women's life for 30-40 years. The major hypoestrogenic consequence is hot flushes but decline in cognitive function, sleep disorders, depression/anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis are also characteristic for the menopause. Current treatments of hot flushes include estrogen therapy alone or in combination with progestins, soy products, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. However, with the exception of estrogens, none of these have satisfactory efficacy. But estrogens come with the unwanted side effects in the periphery, including stimulation of the uterus and breast leading to elevated cancer risk. Therefore, a tremendous effort has been devoted to developing safer therapies and the research has utilized classic rodent models of hot flush with considerable limitations. As hot flushes are primate-specific symptoms, the development of a non-invasive primate hot flush model would have a tremendous impact on drug development. Therefore, our aim was to develop such a non-human primate (NHP) model a hot flush that both recapitulates flushes women experience and is minimally invasive. We investigated if recent developments in thermal imaging have made it possible to accurately monitor skin temperature via camera imaging. In this study, the skin temperature of an ovariectomized rhesus monkey was measured continuously with an infrared camera in a freely moving animal over long time period. Following mapping skin temperatures of several areas of the neck and face we found that the nose of the monkeys showed that largest changes in skin temperature. In the ovariectomized monkey the temperature of the skin on the nose shows up to 9 \u00b0C elevations representing hot flushes. In the untreated monkey, hot flushes occurred more frequently in late afternoon/early evening hours than in the morning and last for several minutes. We observed 58 flushes in the 64 evenings of observation. The average number of hot flushes was 0.51 per evening. Oral administration of biotin (niacin) for seven days exaggerated the number of hot flushes to 2.43 per evening.

In addition, we examine emerging insights suggesting that each can also impact the other, and that all three may collaborate to induce gene-specific AR target gene expression, likely via AR allosteric effects. For the purpose of this review, we refer to the modulating influence of these differential and/or interdependent contributions of ligands, cognate DNA-binding motifs and critical regulatory protein interactions on AR's transcriptional output, which may influence the efficiency of the novel PCa therapeutic approaches under consideration, as co-regulation of AR activity.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32742078": {"ArticleTitle": "Voter Registration and Jail-Incarcerated Women: Are Justice-Involved Women Civically Engaged?", "AbstractText": "Civic engagement, like the broader phenomenon of social engagement, seems out of keeping with the alienating ethos of incarceration.

However, with just a single creatinine concentration included in the denominator of the creatinine clearance equation, the resulting value seems to apply only in the steady state. Does the basic clearance formula work in the nonsteady state, and can it recapitulate the kinetic glomerular filtration rate (GFR) equation? In the kinetic state, a nonlinear creatinine trajectory is reducible into a \"true average\" value that can be found using calculus, proceeding from a differential equation based on the mass balance principle. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we prove definitively that the true average is the correct creatinine to divide by, even as the mathematical model accommodates clinical complexities such as volume change and other factors that affect creatinine kinetics. The true average of a creatinine versus time function between 2 measured creatinine values is found by a definite integral. To use the true average to compute kinetic GFR, 2 techniques are demonstrated, a graphical one and a numerical one. We apply this concept to a clinical case of an individual with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis; despite the effects of hemodialysis on serum creatinine concentration, kinetic GFR was able to track the underlying kidney function and provided critical information regarding kidney function recovery. Finally, a prior concept of the maximum increase in creatinine per day is made more clinically objective. Thus, the clearance paradigm applies to the nonsteady state as well when the true average creatinine is used, providing a fundamentally valid strategy to deduce kinetic GFRs from serum creatinine trends occurring in real-life acute kidney injury and kidney recovery.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32733774": {"ArticleTitle": "A SHORT TEACHING RESIDENCY SPANNING 1,657 MILES.", "AbstractText": "In scientific disciplines, most postdoctoral fellowships focus on research training.

Glioblastoma is a prime example of such difficult-to-treat, invasive, and incurable malignancies. With the advent of the post-genomic age and increased access to next-generation sequencing technologies, numerous publications have described the presence and extent of intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity present in glioblastoma. Moreover, there have been numerous reports more directly correlating the heterogeneity of glioblastoma to its refractory, reoccurring, and inevitably terminal nature. It is therefore prudent to consider the different forms of heterogeneity seen in glioblastoma and how to harness this understanding to better strategize novel therapeutic approaches. One of the most central questions of tumour heterogeneity is how these numerous different cell types (both tumour and non-tumour) in the tumour mass communicate.This chapter provides a brief review on the variable heterogeneity of glioblastoma, with a focus on cellular heterogeneity and on modalities of communication that can induce further molecular diversity within the complex and ever-evolving tumour microenvironment. We provide particular emphasis on the emerging role of actin-based cellular conduits called tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) and tumour microtubes (TMs) and outline the perceived current problems in the field that need to be resolved before pharmacological targeting of TNTs can become a reality.We conclude that TNTs and TMs provide a new and exciting avenue for the therapeutic targeting of glioblastoma and that numerous inroads have already made into TNT and TM biology.

It is accepted that cell-to-cell communication is essential for the development of multicellular systems, and it is coordinated by soluble factors, associated membrane proteins, exosomes, gap junction channels, and TNTs. An old belief in the cancer field is that cancer cells are \"disconnected\" from healthy cells, resulting in loss of cell-to-cell communication and neighbor control. However, recent data obtained from different kind of tumors indicate that TNTs and others forms of communication (exosomes and localized cell-to-cell communication) are highly expressed and functional during tumor development . In physiological conditions, TNTs are expressed by few cells, and their main function is to coordinate long-distance signaling. However, upon carcinogenesis, TNTs proliferate and provide an alternative route of communication to enable the transfer of several signaling molecules and organelles to spread disease and toxicity. We propose that TNTs and their cargo are an attractive therapeutic target to reduce or prevent cancer development.

Chromosomal translocations involving KMT2A often cause the formation of oncogenic fusion genes, such as the most common translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) producing the KMT2A-AFF1 chimera.The aim of this study was to confirm and review the cytogenetic and molecular features of the KMT2A-rearranged RS4;11 cell line and put those in context with other reports of cell lines also harbouring a t(4;11) rearrangement.The main chromosomal rearrangements t(4;11)(q21;q23) and i(7q), described when the cell line was first established, were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and 24-colour karyotyping by M-FISH. Additional cytogenetic abnormalities were investigated by further FISH experiments, including the presence of trisomy 18 as a clonal abnormality and the discovery of one chromosome 8 being an i(8q), which indicates a duplication of the oncogene MYC. A homozygous deletion of 9p21 containing the tumour-suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B was also revealed by FISH. The production of the fusion transcript KMT2A-AFF1 arising from the der(11)t(4;11) was confirmed by RT-PCR, but sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed the presence of multiple isoforms. Two transcript variants, resulting from alternative splicing, were identified differing in one glutamine residue in the translated protein.As karyotype evolution is a common issue in cell lines, we highlight the need to monitor cell lines in order to re-confirm their characteristics over time. We also reviewed the literature to provide a comparison of key features of several cell lines harbouring a t(4;11).

This is even more important at the end-of-life (recycling, recovery and disposal) scenario for a chemical due to the uncertainty in respect of the most susceptible receptors (e.g., workers), pathways (e.g., groundwater), routes (e.g., inhalation) and hazard (e.g., cancer) associated to a chemical exposure. Hence, selecting a group of sustainability performance indicators for estimating the chemical risk when evaluating end-of-life scenarios is a crucial task. Therefore, this manuscript focuses on a critical analysis of the sustainability indicators taxonomy which are used to assess chemical risk to the environment and human health during end-of-life scenarios. The insights from performing an extensive literature search in the largest database of peer-reviewed literature provide that chemical intake, hazard quotient, hazard index, and carcinogenic risk have been the most commonly used for human health chemical risk. In addition, previous research has been less focused on environment chemical risk, with ecological risk index being the most widely used indicator for.

Conventional karyotyping of bone marrow samples has a positivity rate of 20-30% at diagnosis in patients of Multiple Myeloma. However, array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (aCGH) has revealed that almost all MM patients have cytogenetic abnormalities which may affect the pathophysiology, selection of therapy and outcomes of the disease. The progress in the field of exploring the genetic landscape of multiple myeloma with multiple tools like Fluorescent in-situ hybridization, aCGH, Next Generation Sequencing, Flow cytometry, etc., combined with the traditional risk stratification markers like albumin, \u03b22 microglobulin and LDH, is gradually leading towards a risk-adapted therapy. The recent R-ISS risk stratification has combined these two group of information to validate a prognostic score which is an improvement over the past tools like DSS and ISS. In view of the plethora of information available on the multitude of cytogenetic markers there is a tendency to evaluate for all of them at diagnosis, especially in research centers. This leads to a significant increase in the cost of therapy of Multiple Myeloma in day-to-day clinical practice and an increased out-of-pocket spending to the patient, especially in resource-limited settings like India. Also, there is a variable approach to pre-therapy cytogenetic evaluation and risk stratification at different Hematology centres in the country, often dictated by financial constraints and availability of specialized tests. This review discusses the risk stratification markers and tools available in MM in 2019 and how it can be adapted in the resource constraint settings so as to derive the maximum prognostic information from a minimal prognostic panel, as well as lead to standardization of the prognostic protocols in resource limited settings across various Hematology centres in India.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32647417": {"ArticleTitle": "Re-defining Prognosis of Hematological Malignancies by Dynamic Response Assessment Methods: Lessons Learnt in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma.", "AbstractText": "Risk-stratification is an essential management tool in defining prognosis of haematological neoplasms, both from patient and physician perspective.

Immune cells are rare in peripheral nerve, whereas in PNF 30% of the cells are monocytes/macrophages. Mast cells, T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) are also present.

We propose a model based on genetic and pharmacologic evidence in which, after loss of Nf1 in the SC lineage, a lag occurs. Then, mast cells and macrophages are recruited to nerve. Later, T cell/DC recruitment through CXCL10/CXCR3 drives neurofibroma initiation and sustains PNF macrophages and tumor growth.

High expression levels of PD-L1 affect the proliferation and invasiveness of GBM cells. As COX-2 modulates PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, we tested the hypothesis that the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib potentiates anti-PD-1 antibody treatment via the downregulation of PD-L1.Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice injected with murine glioma stem cells (GSCs) were randomly divided into four groups treated with vehicle, celecoxib, anti-PD-1 antibody, or celecoxib plus anti-PD-1 antibody and the antitumor effects of these treatments were assessed. To verify the mechanisms underlying these effects, murine GSCs and human GBM cells were studied in vitro.Compared with that with each single treatment, the combination of celecoxib and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment significantly decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival. The high expression of PD-L1 was decreased by celecoxib in the glioma model injected with murine GSCs, cultured murine GSCs, and cultured human GBM cells.

Such SNVs are common to the extracellular domain of the receptor and functionally result in a receptor that is hypersensitive to low-affinity EGFR ligands. These hypersensitizing SNVs and the ligand-independent EGFRvIII variant are inversely correlated, indicating two distinct modes of evolution to increase EGFR signaling in glioblastomas.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of the four most effective factors (light intensity, temperature, nitrate and salinity concentration) and their interactions on the \u03b2-carotene production and the total chlorophyll/\u03b2-carotene ratio in low light adapted D. salina cells. Box-Benken design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used for this purpose and optimization of the factor levels.

Among the four stress variables for \u03b2-carotene production, light intensity was stronger than the others.

While it is true that some will change their mind as their symptoms change, none-the-less there is a large gap between what people want and what they experience. In addition to the general barriers, there are other others specific to different communities and groups, for instance a 2014 Marie Curie and Alzheimer\u2019s Society17 report highlights that \u2018dementia is often not recognised as a terminal diagnosis, which can lead to poor access to care, inconsistent quality of care d\u2019.. The ability of all health and care professionals to recognise when someone is entering the last year of life and the ability to be able to discuss end of life openly, honestly and sensitively are essential gateways to appropriate end of life care. This chapter reviews the themes found in qualitative work about the barriers to accessing end of life care.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32614547": {"ArticleTitle": "", "AbstractText": "Optimal transition between care settings for an adult who is approaching the end of their life is critical to providing the best standards of care and to meet the wishes and needs of the person set out in advance care plans. The consequences of a person dying in a setting which is inappropriate or not their preferred place of care can have considerable impact upon them and their carers, family and friends. The carers, family and friends\u2019 distress at the death may be exacerbated by the knowledge that it did not happen as the person who died wished.SMOOTH TRANSITIONS: Transition is a purposeful, planned process that addresses the medical, social and psychological needs of a person as they move from one system/place to another. Throughout this guideline many transition points have been identified, for example from one service provider to another, from one setting to another from one age group to another and from one life style to another. There appear to be no studies which are universally applicable to all transitions. Studies have included transitions between teams for example within a hospital or from hospital to home. Usually systems have been developed locally to meet identified problems with transitions, for example the use of a form or computer template, patient held records similar to those used in ante natal care. Probably the group where transition has been studied most is the transfer from children\u2019s to young persons or adult services and most of this work has been undertaken in cancer service and for those with learning difficulties. Another area where work has been undertaken is in the discharge of people from hospital to home and the copying letters to patients is an initiative, which has its roots in this area. There appear to be some principles, which can help to make these transitions smoother. These include effective methods of communication, verbal, written, and electronic, between all those involved. It is most effective if the person who is being transferred and their relatives, carers and those important to them are all included. However there does not appear to be one factor that overwhelmingly contributes to a smooth discharge but a number of things which taken in combination makes transitions smoother. RAPID DISCHARGE: For patients who require rapid discharge to their preferred place of death (usually their home from hospital) there is a need for a clear process that allows for the timely initiation of resources with which to facilitate this care planning. This may or may not necessitate rapid access to specialist palliative care. It is dependent on the patient\u2019s wishes being known to health care professional and relatives usually in the form of and Advanced Care Plan (ACP) and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders and the ability of local system processes to enable the prompt implementation of support services once the patient has arrived at their preferred place of death. As with all rapid discharges what underpins them is effective communication with all parties and clear, concise documentation that allows for a smooth transition of care. With an ever-increasing pressure on services provided by health care providers, there is a widespread recognition that effective discharge planning from the time of admission is essential to enable a patient centred pathway, which is both safe and effective. The rapid discharge of patients is multi-factorial being dependent on realistic estimated day of discharge, senior decision making, effective communication, liaison with other health care partners, the families and most importantly the patient themselves. Much has been written in the literature regarding discharge, which has accumulated in national programmes such as the \u2018SAFER\u2019 bundle and most recently the \u2018End PJ paralysis\u2019 campaign both of which have seen improvements in improving the discharge process for patients.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32601549": {"ArticleTitle": "A Translational Pipeline for Overall Survival Prediction of Breast Cancer Patients by Decision-Level Integration of Multi-Omics Data.", "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent and among the most deadly cancers in females. Patients with breast cancer have highly variable survival rates, indicating a need to identify prognostic biomarkers. By integrating multi-omics data (e.g., gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and copy number variations (CNVs)), it is likely to improve the accuracy of patient survival predictions compared to prediction using single modality data. Therefore, we propose to develop a machine learning pipeline using decision-level integration of multi-omics tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict the overall survival of breast cancer patients. With multi-omics data consisting of gene expression, methylation, miRNA expression, and CNVs, the top performing model predicted survival with an accuracy of 85% and area under the curve (AUC) of 87%. Furthermore, the model was able to identify which modalities best contributed to prediction performance, identifying methylation, miRNA, and gene expression as the best integrated classification combination. Our method not only recapitulated several breast cancer-specific prognostic biomarkers that were previously reported in the literature but also yielded several novel biomarkers. Further analysis of these biomarkers could lend insight into the molecular mechanisms that lead to poor survival.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32601522": {"ArticleTitle": "Towards a Low-Cost and Portable Photoacoustic Microscope for Point-of-Care and Wearable Applications.", "AbstractText": "Several breakthrough applications in biomedical imaging have been reported in the recent years using advanced photoacoustic microscopy imaging systems. While two photon and other optical microscopy systems have recently emerged in portable and wearable form, there is much less work reported on the portable and wearable photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) systems. Working towards this goal, we report our studies on a low-cost and portable photoacoustic microscopy system that uses a custom fabricated 2.5 mm diameter ring ultrasound transducer integrated with a fiber-coupled laser diode. The ultrasound transducer is centered at 17.25 MHz, and shows ~ 45% and ~ 100% fractional bandwidths for ultrasound pulse-echo and photoacoustic A-line signals respectively. To achieve overall system portability, besides the imaging head, other backend imaging system components need to be readily portable as well. In this direction, we have studied the potential use of compact pre-amplifiers, scanning stages and microcontroller based data acquisition and reconstruction for photoacoustic imaging. The portable PAM system is validated by imaging phantoms embedded with light absorbing targets.

The diagnosis of candidemia was established according to the single isolation of Candida spp. from blood culture and the presence of symptoms of infection.Over 12 years (2006-2017), candidemia was diagnosed in 75 patients aged 17 to 77 years (median 48 years). The causative agents of candidemia were C. albicans in 34.7% of patients, C. non - albicans - in 65.3%. Candidemia caused by C. albicans prevailed in patients of the older age group (median 56.5 years, p=0.04) and in patients with lymphoma (61.5%, p=0.01) with colonization of the gut by the same species of Candida (88.5%, p=0.002). Isolation of C. non - albicans from blood culture was more common in patients with acute leukemia (51%, p=0.01) and in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (22.5%, p=0.01). The ability to form biofilms was observed more frequently among C. non - albicans (59.2%) than C. albicans (19.2%, p=0.001). The clinical symptoms of candidemia were non - specific (fever was in 97%). Septic shock developed in 25 (33%) patients with comparable frequency in both groups. Concomitant infections was also comparable (73% vs. 73.5%). Overall 30-day survival in patients with candidemia caused by C. albicans and C. non - albicans was 61.2% and 61.5%. Treatment with echinocandin was associated with increase of survival compared to other antifungal agents among patients with C. albicans candidaemia (88.9% versus 40%, p=0.02) and among C. non - albicans (77.3% versus 47.8%).C. non - albicans constituted a high proportion among causative agents of candidemia. High mortality rate was observed in both groups.

characterized by recurrent and remitting course of the disease, the transformation of a tumor into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is possible. In generalized lesions and progression of FL, the most commonly used courses are R-CHOP and R-B. The choice of therapy for different cytological types, clinical and laboratory parameters remains disputable.To analyze the clinical, laboratory, morphological parameters of patients with FL, who got R-B and R-CHOP therapy; determine the criteria for selecting induction therapy.The study included 203 patients with FL from 2000 to 2018. R-CHOP treatment was initiated in 126 patients, 14 of whom later received high - dose therapy (HDT) (R-DHAP: rituximab, dexamethasone, cisplatin, cytarabine) without autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT), 21 - HDT with autoSCT; treatment of 89 patients was limited to courses of R-CHOP and maintenance therapy with rituximab, two patients (in whom the disease progressed, despite R-CHOP therapy) were assigned the mNHL-BFM-90 program. The efficacy of treatment on various treatment regimens was evaluated primarily by overall survival.R-B. 77 patients received R-B therapy. Complete remission of the disease was achieved in 47/77 (61%) patients (3 of them later developed a relapse of the disease), partial remission was achieved in 15/77 (19%) patients, in 13/77 (17%) cases progression was recorded tumors. 70 patients had 1-2 cytological type of tumor, 6 patients - 3A cytological type. In cases of progression, 3 of 13 patients (46%) were diagnosed with 3A cytological type FL. Median observation (at the time of analysis) - 34 months. R-CHOP. 89 patients with FL received high - dose therapy with R-CHOP (6-8 courses) and maintenance therapy with rituximab. In 39 (44%) patients, the disease remained in remission, and in 50 (56%), a relapse of the disease developed. 50 patients had 1-2 cytological types, 39 - 3 cytological types. In cases of recurrence of FL, a 3A cytologic type (36%) was diagnosed in 18/50 patients. Median observation - 93 months. R-CHOP + HDT and autoSCT. 21 patients after the R-CHOP courses continued (due to insufficient antitumor response) high - dose chemotherapy (HDT) and auto-SCT were performed. In 18/21 (86%) cases, complete remission of the disease was achieved and maintained, in 3 (14%) cases relapse developed. 16 patients had 1-2 cytological types, 5 - 3 cytological types. Median observation - 81 months. R-CHOP + HDT without autoSCT. 14 patients started therapy under the R-CHOP program as induction therapy, but then (due to insufficient antitumor response), the treatment was continued according to the HDT without autoSCT. 11 (79%) patients are currently in remission of the disease, in 3 (21%) - there was a relapse. 10 patients had 2 cytological types of PL, 4 - 3 cytological types. 11 (79%) patients are currently in remission of the disease, in 3 (21%) - there was a relapse. Median observation - 80 months. 7-year OS of patients with FL on RB therapy was 89% (95% CI 75-99), on R-CHOP therapy - 85% (95% CI 73-90), on R-CHOP + HDT and autoSCT - 87% (95% CI 57-100), on R-CHOP + HDT without autoSCT - 82%. 7-year PFS of FL patients on RB therapy was 70% (95% CI 75-99), on R-CHOP therapy - 44% (95% CI 73-90), on R-CHOP + HDT and autoSCT - 74% (95% CI 57-100), on R-CHOP + HDT without autoSCT - 80%.The R-B is most effective in FL 1 and 2 cytological types. The cytological type does not correspond to the type of tumor growth: at 3A and 3A + 3B cytological types, nodular / nodular - diffuse and diffuse types of growth are found. When choosing an induction course, one should look at the cytological type of FL. A high proliferative activity index (according to Ki67) is a predictor of resistance to R-B therapy. The absence of an interfollicular T-cell reaction in tumor tissue FL is associated with tumor chemoresistance. The presence of the bulky factor is associated (in most patients) with the FLIPI index with values from 3 to 5, and is a predictor of a poor response to therapy. Patients with bulky, high (more than 35%) Ki67 index and FLIPI from 3 to 5 in the debut of the disease as the first line therapy, it is preferable to choose the R-CHOP mode, and in the absence of (after 4-6 courses) to complete or partial remission to continue conducting the HDT.\u0424\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u043c\u0444\u043e\u043c\u0430 (\u0424\u041b) - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437 \u0412-\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430, \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c;

A literature review and own data].", "AbstractText": "Eight patients were observed with a rare combination of thymoma and pure red cell aplasia of bone marrow (PRCA), of which seven women were between 44 to 68 years old. The diagnosis of PRCA was established before the detection of thymoma in 1 patient, simultaneously in 3, after - in 4. Seven patients underwent timomectomy. The weight of removed thymomas was from 200 to 780 grams. Morphological type A thymoma variant (spindle cell) was installed in 2 patients, type B1 - in 2, type B2 - in 2, type B3 - in 2. Complete remissions were obtained using cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin in 5 patients, lasting from 6 months to 7 years. The results of immunological studies with the identification of non - hemolytic antibodies to the proteolytic antigen (Pr1d) on the erythrocyte membrane in 4 patients are presented. Of these, two studied patients simultaneously detected antibodies to the Pr1d antigen and the interspecific antigen of mammalian erythroblasts (IAME). It is shown that the lifespan of red blood cells are not changed. The direct Coombs test was negative in 5 patients, but with the help of aggregate hemaglutination test and enzyme immunoassay, antibodies were detected on the surface of erythrocytes. The pathogenesis of this combination of diseases remains unclear and needs to be elucidated.\u041d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 8 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0442\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043c\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0438 (\u041f\u041a\u041a\u0410), \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 7 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442 44 \u0434\u043e 68 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0414\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437 \u041f\u041a\u041a\u0410 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0434\u043e \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043c\u044b \u0443 1 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e -

In all cases, recurrent thrombosis allowed to suspect the presence of two diseases - MPN and APS.\u0422\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u043e\u0437 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043b\u044b\u043c \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438. \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0441\u0444\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c (\u0410\u0424\u0421) \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0440\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430, \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043c \u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0441\u0444\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b. \u0412\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0438\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 (\u041c\u041f\u0417). \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0432 Ph-\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u041c\u041f\u0417, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u0410\u0424\u0421. \u0412\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044f\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0431\u043e\u0437\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 - \u041c\u041f\u0417 \u0438 \u0410\u0424\u0421.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": ["Abortion, Habitual", "Adult", "Antibodies, Antiphospholipid", "Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Neoplasms", "Pregnancy", "Thrombosis", "Venous Thrombosis"]}, "32598740": {"ArticleTitle": "[Epidemiology of multiple myeloma in city Moscow].", "AbstractText": "To study the epidemiology of multiple myeloma in the city of Moscow and compare the results obtained with data from similar studies in other countries.The study is based on information from a database of case histories of 3942 patients suffering from symptomatic MM, residents of the city of Moscow, which is maintained at the Hematologic Moscow City Center of S.P. Botkin Municipal Clinical Hospital. The control of the completeness of inclusion was carried out by cross - comparison with the data of the Moscow Cancer Register and the Register of Program 7 (beginning in 2019 - 12) of Highly Expensive Nosologies. The assessment was made according to data as of January 1, 2019. The calculations were carried out taking into account the data of Rosstat at the beginning of 2019 on the population of Moscow in different gender and age categories.Among the 3942 patients with active MM 1707 men - 43% and 2241 women - 57%, the median of the current age was 68 (28-94) years. The median time of observation of patients since the diagnosis of the disease 34 (1-423) months. The peak incidence was in the age range of more than 60 years. There were no significant differences in gender ratio in different age strata with a breakdown of 10 years. The number of cases of newly diagnosed MM per year for the period from 2009 (n=219) to 2018 (n=385) increased by 75.8%. At the same time, the demonstrated increase in the incidence rate for the described period turned out to be fair only for groups of patients over 50 years old, with the maximum increase in this indicator over the described period in the age range of 60-69 years. This is mainly due to the increase in life expectancy in Moscow in recent years. The study demonstrated that over the past 10 years, the average annual mortality rate from MM has decreased in Moscow, and as a result, its prevalence has increased. The rate of 2-year overall survival of patients with MM was 76%, 5-year - old - 49%, 10-year - old - 27%. The median overall survival of patients under the age of 65 when diagnosing the disease was 79 months, and 48 months. The distribution of patients within international classifications was consistent with international data.The study revealed a significant dynamic of the epidemiological situation concerning MM in Moscow. Over the past 10 years there has been an increase in the incidence of MM, as a result of an increase in the life expectancy of the population.

Obtained images were visually and semi - quantitatively analyzed. Focal areas of increased uptake for every radiopharmaceutical agent (hypermetabolic foci) not associated with its physiological distribution were registered. Maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) in pathological foci were automatically calculated for every radiopharmaceutical agent separately. PET/CT findings were compared to antitumor response achieved after auto-HSCT according to International MM Working Group criteria.After auto-HSCT, the majority of patients (16/60%) achieved a complete response. Abnormal 18F-FDG uptake was registered in 37% (n=10) of patients, negative PET findings were obtained in 63% (n=17) of patients. 11C-methionine PET/CT revealed hypermetabolic foci in 67% (n=18) of patients, and there was no 11C-methionine uptake in 33% (n=9).

protein in the urine met the criteria of hematological response.This study included 13 MM with dialysis - dependent renal impairment patients (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 10 ml/min), whose urine BJ protein content was less than 200 mg/day after antimyeloma therapy (including 11 patients whose urine BJ protein content was less than 100 mg/day).The median serum concentration of monoclonal

The median age was 61 year (29-81); the male to female ratio was 48/36. T-cell and B-cell clonality was assessed by GeneScan analysis of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCRG, TCRB) and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. For the quantitative determination of cells with RHOA G17V mutation real - time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with allele - specific LNA modified primers was used.In lymph nodes rearrangements of T-cell receptor genes were determined in 76 (90.5%) of 84 patients and were absent in 8 (9.5%) cases. Identification of the same clonal products of the TCRG and TCRB genes in the lymph node and in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow indicated the prevalence of the tumor process and was observed in 64.7% of patients. Clonal products in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow different from those in the lymph node indicated reactive cytotoxic lymphocyte population and were noted in 58.8% of AITL cases. Simultaneous detection of T- and B-cell clonality in the lymph node was observed in 20 (24.7%) of 81 patients. Cells with RHOA G17V mutation were detected in lymph node in 45 (54.9%) of 82 patients. The use of allele - specific PCR with LNA modified primers revealed presence of the tumor cells in peripheral blood in 100% and in bone marrow in 93.9% of patients with G17V RHOA mutation in the lymph nodes.The validity of different molecular assays performed on certain tissue samples for the diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma has been evaluated.

Retrospective analysis of single - centre data].", "AbstractText": "Aim of the issue was to compare clinical characteristics and treatment results of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) with translocations involving loci of c-MYC/8q24, BCL2/18q21 and/or BCL6/3q27 genes and patients with high - grade B-cell lymphoma [High - grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), double - hit (DH)]. Materials and methods. Since 2004 to 2017 years in National Research Center for Hematology 12 patients with high - grade B-cell lymphoma double - hit (HGBL DH) and 6 FL patients with translocations involving c-MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 had been treated. We performed a comparative analysis of clinical characterisctics in both groups. As primary endpoints was assessed frequency of complete remission (CR) or progressive disease (PD); as secondary endpoints - overall (OS) and event - free survival (EFS). Results. 5 patients with HGBL DH had c-MYC/BCL6, 7 - c-MYC/BCL2 rearrangements; 2 patients with FL had c-MYC/BCL2, 3 - c-MYC/BCL6, 1 - c-MYC/BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements. FL was represented by grade 3A in 2, grade 3B - in 4 cases, 3 of them had large - cell transformation. In HGBL DH and FL patients had no significant differences in clinical characteristics. The majority of patients had a widespread tumour, increased LDH activity, high frequency of extranodal and bone marrow involvement. Ki-67 expression level was lower in patients with FL (p.\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b: \u0441\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u043c\u0444\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439 (\u0424\u041b) \u0441 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0441-MYC/8q24, BCL2/18q21 \u0438/\u0438\u043b\u0438 BCL6/3q27 \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0412-\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u043c\u0444\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 [high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL)], double-hit (DH). \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u0421 2004 \u043f\u043e 2017 \u0433. \u0432 \u0424\u0413\u0411\u0423 \u00ab\u041d\u041c\u0418\u0426 \u0433\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438\u00bb \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c 12 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043e\u043c HGBL DH \u0438 6 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0424\u041b \u0441 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 c-MYC, BCL2 \u0438/\u0438\u043b\u0438 BCL6. \u041c\u044b \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0438\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0412 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (\u041f\u0420) \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440), \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 - \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f (\u041e\u0412) \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u0411\u0421\u0412). \u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b. \u0423 5 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441 HGBL DH \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 c-MYC/BCL6, \u0443 7 - c-MYC/BCL2;

R-CHOP-like regimens allow to achieve high response rate, but the overall survival (OS) are disappointingly short - 3-4 years. An addition of high - dose cytarabine to the upfront therapy and autoSCT significantly improved outcomes but remain feasible largely for medically fit patients. Based on the activity and good tolerance of gemcitabine - oxaliplatin schemes in relapsed and refractory MCL patients, we developed an alternative first - line course for patients who are not eligible for R-HD-MTX-AraC.Assess toxicity and efficacy of R-DA-EPOCH/ R-HD-MTX-AraC and R-DA-EPOCH/R-GIDIOX schemes, autoSCT and R-maintenance in untreated MCL patients.47 untreated MCL patients from 6 centers were enrolled in prospective study between April 2008 and September 2013. All patients have stage II-V; ECOG 0-3; median age 55 years (29-64); Male/Female 76%/24%. MIPIb: 28% low, 33% intermediate and 39% high risk. Following 1st R-EPOCH patients were assigned to receive either R-DA-EPOCH/ R-HD-MTX-AraC or R-DA-EPOCH/ R-GIDIOX regimen. In the absence of renal failure, hematological toxicity grade 4 more than 3 days and severe infections patients received R-HD-MTX-AraC scheme (R 375 mg/m2 Day 0, Methotrexate 1000 mg/m2/24 hours Day 1, AraC 3000 mg/m2 q 12 hrs Days 2-3). Patients who had at least one of these complications received R-GIDIOX scheme (R 375 mg/m2 day 0, gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 days 1 and 4, ifosfamide 1000 mg/m2 days 1-5, dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 IV days 1-5, irinotecan 100 mg/m2 day 3, oxaliplatin 120 mg/m2 day 2). Subsequently these courses were alternating with R-DA-EPOCH in each arm of the protocol. Depending on the time of achieving CR patients received 6 or 8 courses, unless they progressed on therapy. Those patients who achieved PR/CR/CRu underwent autoSCT (BEAM-R). Post - transplant R-maintenance was administered for 3 years (R - 375 mg/m2 every 3 months).29/47 patients were treated on R-HD-MTX-AraC arm (median 50 years; MIPIb: 35.7% low, 28.6% intermediate, 35.7% high risk) and 18/47 patients were on R-GIDIOX arm (median 60 years; MIPIb: 16.7% low, 38.9% intermediate, 44.4% high risk). In R-HD-MTX-AraC arm CR rate was 96.5%. In R-GIDIOX arm OR and CR rates were 94.4% and 77.7% respectively. Main hematological toxicity of R-GIDIOX was leukopenia gr. 4 occurred in 74.1%. With median follow - up of 76 months, the estimated 7-years OS and EFS in R-HD-MTX-AraC arm are 76% and 57% respectively. In R-GIDIOX arm the estimated 7-years OS and EFS are 59% and 44%, respectively. There are no statistical differences in EFS (p=0.47) and OS (p=0.06) between two arms.The use of a risk - adapted strategy allowed 95.7% of patients achieve PR/CR/CRu, performed autoSCT and begun R-maintenance therapy with rituximab. None of the patients needed a premature discontinuation of therapy because of unacceptable toxicity. The performance of autoSCT and R-maintenance apparently allowed to partially offset differences in the intensity of induction therapy and to maintain comparable results of therapy in both induction

lymphoma not otherwise specified. Data of prospective study].", "AbstractText": "Aim of the issue was to determine indications for intratecal chemotherapy drugs administration to prevent relapse of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.Since January 2009 to December 2018 102 patients with primary nodal DLBCL over 18 years old were treated in the National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation. Diagnosis were established in all cases according to histological and immunohistochemical studies which made it possible to exclude the transformation of mature B-cell lymphoma into DLBCL.Isolated leptomeningeal involvement of CNS in the debut of the disease was detected in 1 (0.98%) out of 102 patients with DLBCL. Focal brain tissue involvement was not detected in any patient. More than half of the patients (54%) had a high risk of disease recurrence or progression with CNS involvement: in 8 (7.8%) patients had kidney/adrenal involvement, in the same proportion - bone marrow involvement, paranasal sinuses involvement - in 5 (4.9 %), epidural space - in 7 (6.9%) and breast - in 5 (4.9%) of patients. In 82 (80%) patients, a non-GCB (postgerminal differentiation of B-cell analog) molecular subtype of DLBCL was determined.The introduction of chemotherapy drugs into the spinal canal is recommended in isolated cases of leptomeningeal involvement of CNS at the time of DLBCL onset and is carried out according to standard recommendations. Prevention of relapse with involvement of central nervous system using intratecal chemotherapy in patients with nodal form of DLBCL is not indicated due to the absence of cases with disease progression or recurrence into CNS when patients were treated with R-m-NHL-BFM-90, R-DA-EPOCH and R-CHOP protocol.\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b

MRI-findings in Ph - negative myeloproliferative disorders].", "AbstractText": "Myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are accompanied by a high proportion of thrombotic complications, which may lead to cerebrovascular disease (CVD).To describe MRI-findings in patients with Ph - negative MPD and evaluate any cerebrovascular disease.We included 104 patients with Ph - negative MPD (age varied between 20 and 58) with clinical correlates of cerebrovascular pathology.Brain MRI showed post - stroke lesions in 20% of patients (7 hemispheric infarcts due to thrombotic occlusion of one of the large cerebral arteries, 14 - cortical infarcts). 37 patients (36%) had vascular cerebral lesions. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurred in 5 patients - in 7% (n=3) of patients with polycythemia vera and 5% (n=2) - in patients with essential thrombocythemia. The incidence of vascular cerebral lesions was associated with higher levels of the following: erythrocyte, platelet count, fibrinogen, and with the decrease in fibrinolytic activity, as well.The pioneering results of the study include the description and analysis of brain MRI-findings in patients with Ph - negative MPD. The underlying mechanisms of cerebrovascular pathology in these patients are associated with certain blood alterations (particularly, hemorheology) which present a major risk factor.\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438 Ph-\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0438\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445 (\u041c\u041f\u0417) \u0441 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e -

CHIP is characterized by the presence of a myeloid cells clone in peripheral blood in the absence of the sufficient reasons to diagnose the hematologic disease. The CHIP is proposed as a potential independent risk factor for vascular pathology. The aim of this study is to identify carriers of JAK2 V617F mutation among patients admitted for planned hospitalization at the Federal Center of Cardiovascular Surgery of Krasnoyarsk.The study included 930 venous blood samples. JAK2 V617F mutation was detected by using the allele - specific real time polymerase chain reaction.JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 15 (1.6%) patients, but only two of them had blood cell count that could cause a hematological disease to be suspected.The inclusion of the JAK2 V617F mutation detection in the complex of laboratory tests of the cardiovascular patients can facilitate the timely identification of patients with increased thrombotic risk, as well as the timely diagnosis of myeloproliferative diseases.\u0421\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f V617F \u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435 JAK2 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0438\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043f\u043e\u044d\u0437\u0430 \u00ab\u043d\u0435\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430\u00bb, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430 CHIP (clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential). \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c CHIP \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0438\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435 CHIP \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438. \u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b -

It was shown that the 5-years overall survival in AML younger than 60 years patients improved from 20 to 33%, in ALL - from 38 to 65%, in APL - from 0 to 95%. The cooperative work resulted in balanced clinical recommendations and protocols, reproducible in regional hospitals. Though till now there is a big difference in the long term outcome in acute leukemias patients treated in coordinating or regional centers mostly due to much higher early death rate: 7.5-9.5% vs 18-25%. This parameter should be used as criteria of the total efficacy of hematological service in each region of Russia. It became possible within the last years to integrate the minimal residual disease monitoring into clinical trials thus providing a clue parameter for choosing the further therapy - allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Non - chemotherapeutic approach with arsenic trioxide and all - trans retinoid acid had dramatically changed the toxicity and duration of treatment with very high efficacy. The Russian cooperative group was the first that started to include pregnant women with acute leukemias into clinical trials. This prospective and prolonged experience has shown that pregnancy in acute myeloid leukemia is an extremely poor prognostic factor, but it does not influence the outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b

An increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer has been noted over the past decade, mainly due to papillary cancer. The influence of environmental factors, increased availability of medical care, including sensitive diagnostic tests, such as ultrasound and fine - needle aspiration (FNA), can affect the fact of the growth of this incidence. Palpation of thyroid gland has very low diagnostic value for detecting thyroid cancer, while thyroid ultrasound and FNA can detect malignant tumors in 20% of cases. Today, the FNA is the fastest, most accurate, economically accessible, and quite safe method for cytological diagnosis of the thyroid nodules. And molecular genetic testing of FNA samples could serve as an additional reliable diagnostic tool in the case of atypia of undetermined significance.\u0420\u0430\u043a

This review demonstrates the association between the pathology of the biliary tract and oncological diseases of the digestive system, discusses the possible mechanisms of the influence of cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy on the development of malignant neoplasms of various parts of the gastrointestinal tract.\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u043e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u041e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e - \u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0430 (\u0416\u041a\u0422) \u043d\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0438\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0449\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430, \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0437\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439. \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u044b \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044d\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0416\u041a\u0422.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": ["Biliary Tract", "Biliary Tract Diseases", "Cholecystectomy", "Cholelithiasis", "Digestive System Neoplasms", "Humans", "Risk Factors"]}, "32597128": {"ArticleTitle": "An overview of microtubule targeting agents for cancer therapy.", "AbstractText": "The entire world is looking for effective cancer therapies whose benefits would outweigh their toxicity.

In this review we address the current knowledge about microtubule-targeting agents or drugs (MTAs/MTDs) used in cancer therapy from their synthesis to toxicities. Synthetic and natural MTAs exhibit antitumor activity, and preclinical and clinical studies have shown that their anticancer effectiveness is higher than that of traditional drug therapies. Furthermore, MTAs involve a lower risk of adverse effects such as neurotoxicity and haemotoxicity. Several new generation MTAs are currently being evaluated for clinical use.

The aim of this study was to construct a comprehensive instrument for the appraisal of clinical practice guidelines in China (AGREE-CHINA), and to validate its reliability as a tool for helping potential guideline users in assessing guideline quality.First, an interdisciplinary working group was established for developing the methods. They also created a checklist as a tool according to the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) standards, considering the particularity of Chinese clinical practice. Next, the first draft of AGREE-China was developed by vote, modification, preliminary trial, and cross-verification. To ensure the objectivity, credibility, and reproducibility of the draft assessment, all of the checklists and standards were cross-reviewed fairly widely. Finally, AGREE-CHINA and AGREE II were used to assess the Chinese guidelines published in the past five years, and the results were compared.The presented AGREE-CHINA covered five main checkpoints (science and rigor, effectiveness and safety, economy, usability and feasibility, and conflicts of interest) with each point divided into several more specific checkpoints. Definitions and rationales for each main checkpoint appear in the Appendix. The quality ratings based on the total scores of AGREE-China and AGREE II were consistent (r = 0.508, P = 0.020). Compared with AGREE II, the study showed a higher level of interrater-reliability for AGREE-CHINA overall (ICC = 0.957, P < 0.001). The mean time required for AGREE-CHINA was less than that for AGREE II; this was approximately 30 minutes for every assessment. User satisfaction was generally high.This paper has presented the first edition of the AGREE-CHINA appraisal tool for clinical guidelines.

For cases that are node negative, the role of definitive concurrent chemoradiation is unclear and not supported by guidelines but used at provider discretion. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the oncological outcomes with additional chemotherapy and factors correlated with the chemotherapy administration.We queried the National Cancer Database for patients with early stage (T2N0M0) laryngeal SCC treated nonsurgically. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of chemotherapy. Multivariable Cox regression evaluated predictors of survival. Propensity matching accounted for indication biases.We identified 7181 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, of which 1568 (22%) patients received chemotherapy in addition to radiation. Predictors of chemotherapy use included younger age, Caucasian race, more remote year of treatment, higher grade, sites other than glottis, treatment at a community cancer center, and use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Median overall survival was not significantly different in the two arms analyzed-65 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 60, 72months) with chemotherapy compared to 70 months without chemotherapy (95% CI 66, 75 months, P<.37).

These areas are known to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of cigarette smoke, and in addition, nicotine has been hypothesized to play a role in disease pathogenesis. Acute toxicity will also be discussed. The literature to February 2019 suggests that there is no increased cardiovascular risk of nicotine exposure in consumers who have no underlying cardiovascular pathology. There is scientific consensus that nicotine is not a direct or complete carcinogen, however, it remains to be established whether it plays some role in human cancer propagation and metastasis. These cancer progression pathways have been proposed in models in vitro and in transgenic rodent lines in vivo but have not been demonstrated in cases of human cancer. Further studies are needed to determine whether nicotine is linked to decreased fertility in humans.

The study aimed to assess any potential relationship between MPV and presence of H. pylori, as well as the severity of chronic gastric inflammation. A total of 6890 endoscopic reports were initially evaluated, and a total of 218 dyspeptic patients having undergone upper endoscopy were included. Of these, 118 (54.2%) were H. pylori positive and 100 (45.8%) were H. pylori negative. At least four gastric biopsies were obtained and evaluated according to Sydney classification. Age, gender, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, serum iron and C-reactive protein, as well as endoscopic findings were also recorded. A p<0.05 was accepted as significant. The MPV and platelet count did not differ between H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative groups of patients (p>0.05).

Interestingly, increasing evidences have shown involvement of glutamate signaling, guided through their receptors, in human malignancy. Dysregulation of glutamate transporters, such as excitatory amino acid transporter and cystine/glutamate antiporter system, also generates excessive extracellular glutamate, which in turn, activates glutamate receptors on cancer cells and results in malignant growth.

The increasing biological studies and scientific experiments have proven that miRNAs are related to the occurrence and development of a large number of key biological processes which cause complex human diseases. Thus, identifying the association between miRNAs and disease is helpful to diagnose the diseases. Although some studies have found considerable associations between miRNAs and diseases, there are still a lot of associations that need to be identified. Experimental methods to uncover miRNA-disease associations are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, effective computational methods are urgently needed to predict new associations.In this work, we propose an integrated method for predicting potential associations between miRNAs and diseases (IMPMD). The enhanced similarity for miRNAs is obtained by combination of functional similarity, gaussian similarity and Jaccard similarity. To diseases, it is obtained by combination of semantic similarity, gaussian similarity and Jaccard similarity. Then, we use these two enhanced similarities to construct the features and calculate cumulative score to choose robust features. Finally, the general linear regression is applied to assign weights for Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression algorithms.IMPMD obtains AUC of 0.9386 in 10-fold cross-validation, which is better than most of the previous models. To further evaluate our model, we implement IMPMD on two types of case studies for lung cancer and breast cancer. 49 (Lung Cancer) and 50 (Breast Cancer) out of the top 50 related miRNAs are validated by experimental discoveries.We built a software named IMPMD which can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Sunmile/IMPMD.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32581645": {"ArticleTitle": "Cell-free microRNAs as Non-invasive Diagnostic and Prognostic Bio- markers in Pancreatic Cancer.", "AbstractText": "Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with an increasing global incidence rate.

Inspired by the effectiveness of deep neural networks in evaluating perceptual similarity of natural images, in this paper, we propose TriNet-P, a color-perceptual similarity metric for whole slide images, based on deep metric embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach using four publicly available breast cancer histological datasets.

However, these models exploit only the local information within each patch and lost the connections between the neighboring patches, which may contain important context information. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale convolutional network (ConvNet) to utilize the built-in image pyramids of WSI. For the concentric image patches cropped at the same location of different resolution levels, we hypothesize the extra input images from lower magnifications will provide context information to enhance the prediction of patch images. We build corresponding ConvNets for feature representation and then combine the extracted features by 1) late fusion: concatenation or averaging the feature vectors before performing classification, 2) early fusion: merge the ConvNet feature maps. We have applied the multi-scale networks to a benchmark breast cancer WSI dataset. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our multiscale networks utilizing the WSI image pyramids can achieve higher accuracy for the classification of breast cancer.

Potential predictors of OS were age, gender, race, tobacco use, oral cancer sub-sites, pathologic tumor stage and grade, pathologic nodal stage, extra-capsular invasion, clinical levels IV and V involvement, and adjuvant treatment selection. Weighted propensity scores for treatment were used to balance observed baseline characteristics between three treatment groups in order to reduce bias. Following primary surgery, patients underwent observation (56%), radiation alone (31%) or chemoradiation (13%). All tested predictors were statistically significant and included in our final nomogram. Most important predictor of OS was age, followed by pathologic tumor stage.

Radiosensitizers are an established method of enhancing RT cell killing through the addition of a pharmaceutical agent. Though the majority of trials using radiosensitizers have historically been unsuccessful, there continues to be interest with a variety of approaches having been employed. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, and a number of other molecularly targeted agents have all been investigated as potential methods of radiosensitization in the temozolomide era. Outcomes have varied both in terms of toxicity and survival, but some agents such as valproic acid and bortezomib have demonstrated promising results. However, reporting of results in phase 2 trials in newly diagnosed GBM have been inconsistent, with no standard in reporting progression-free survival and toxicity. There is a pressing need for investigation of new agents; however, nearly all phase 3 trials of GBM patients of the past 25 years have demonstrated no improvement in outcomes.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify clinical variables associated with this outcome.The percentage of patients who initially received stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiation therapy, or TKI alone was 22%, 61%, and 17%, respectively. Median overall survival in these subgroups was 31.1, 14.6, and 24.6 months, respectively (P = .0016). The 5-year incidence of ND among all patients was 40% and did not significantly vary according to treatment group. In a multivariable model, only leptomeningeal disease at any point in a patient's disease course significantly correlated with ND (hazard ratio 4.75, P <.001).Among our cohort of patients with BrM from EGFRm NSCLC, the incidence of ND was significantly higher than suggested by previous reports. BrM should be considered a driver of mortality in many patients with EGFRm NSCLC, and treatments providing better control of BrM, lower neurocognitive side effects, and maintenance of quality of life are needed.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32529125": {"ArticleTitle": "Are Female Radiation Oncologists Still Underrepresented in the Published Literature?

Damage in any step of the immune cycle is one of the most important causes of immunotherapy failure. Impairments in the immune cycle can be restored by epigenetic modification, including reprogramming the environment of tumor-associated immunity, eliciting an immune response by increasing the presentation of tumor antigens, and by regulating T cell trafficking and reactivation.

Thyroid cancer in children is a rare disease; however, since 2011, many children in Fukushima, Japan, have been diagnosed with it, and the number has shown a steady increase to over 200 cases at present. Some experts have stated that this phenomenon is due to overdiagnosis caused by thyroid ultrasound (US)-based thyroid screening detecting self-limiting thyroid cancer, which will not lead to clinical symptoms in the future. Harm caused by overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is more serious in the young, since it is difficult to perform active surveillance and children diagnosed with cancer are likely to suffer from stigma. Thus, overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the young is not only a health problem but also a problem of human rights. Conflicts of interest among people related to screening programs and some experts with incomplete knowledge on overdiagnosis help to spread misleading opinions together with fear of radiation exposure among residents, which has led to their erroneous understanding of the nature of US-based thyroid screening.

Like U1 role in splicing, telescripting requires U1 snRNA base-pairing with nascent transcripts. Inhibition of U1 base-pairing with U1 snRNA antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (U1 AMO) mimics widespread PCPA from cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in human tissues, including PCPA in introns and last exons' 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs). U1 telescripting-PCPA balance changes generate diverse RNAs depending on where in a gene it occurs. Long genes are highly U1-telescripting-dependent because of PASs in introns compared to short genes. Enrichment of cell cycle control, differentiation, and developmental functions in long genes, compared to housekeeping and acute cell stress response genes in short genes, reveals a gene size-function relationship in mammalian genomes. This polarization increased in metazoan evolution by previously unexplained intron expansion, suggesting that U1 telescripting could shift global gene expression priorities. We show that that modulating U1 availability can profoundly alter cell phenotype, such as cancer cell migration and invasion, underscoring the critical role of U1 homeostasis and suggesting it as a potential target for therapies. We describe a complex of U1 with cleavage and polyadenylation factors that silences PASs in introns and 3' UTR, which gives insights into U1 telescripting mechanism and transcription elongation regulation.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32514467": {"ArticleTitle": "Salvage therapy in cancer patients with hepatitis C without sustained virologic response after direct-acting antivirals-A prospective study.", "AbstractText": "No information exists regarding direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) salvage therapy for Hepatitis C (HCV)-infected patients with any type of cancer.

Unresectable duodenal disease and severe dysplasia are an indication for prophylactic radical surgery by pancreaticoduodenectomy or pancreas-sparing duodenectomy. Some preliminary results have shown better outcomes with duodenectomy. A 45-year-old female with FAP had restorative proctocolectomy at 24 years, desmoid of the mesentery with regression after sulindac, two pregnancies, and at the age of 37 years had duodenal polyposis stage III carpeting the periampullary region. Endoscopic papillectomy and extensive piecemeal mucosectomy was performed but was unsuccessful due to recurrence. After 7 years of regular endoscopic surveillance, focal high-grade dysplasia was diagnosed at the last evaluation. Some diminutive polyps were seen in the small-bowel capsule endoscopy. MRCP showed a normal biliary and pancreatic duct without visualization of the Santorini duct. A pancreas and pylorus-preserving duodenectomy was performed with 3 main steps: (1) duodenectomy with preservation of the pancreas and the pylorus; (2) reconstruction with an advanced jejunal limb and duodenojejunostomy; (3) reimplantation of the biliary and pancreatic duct in the jejunal loop. The patient was discharged on the 11th postoperative day without complications. In conclusion, pancreas- and pylorus-preserving duodenectomy is a promising alternative to pancreaticoduodenectomy for advanced duodenal polyposis that allows complete endoscopic surveillance.A maioria dos doentes portadores de polipose adenomatosa familiar (FAP) vem a desenvolver p\u00f3lipos duodenais que poder\u00e3o degenerar em 5% dos casos.

Many cancer patients cannot maintain oral feeding and develop malnutrition. The authors aim to: review the endoscopic, radiologic and surgical techniques for nutritional support in cancer patients; address the strategies for nutritional intervention according to the selected technique; and establish a decision-making algorithm to define the best approach in a specific tumour setting.This is a narrative non-systematic review based on an electronic search through the medical literature using PubMed and UpToDate. The impossibility of maintaining oral feeding is a major cause of malnutrition in head and neck (H&N) cancer, oesophageal tumours and malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Tube feeding, endoscopic stents and gastrojejunostomy are the three main nutritional options. Nasal tubes are indicated for short-term enteral feeding. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the gold standard when enteral nutrition is expected for more than 3-4 weeks, especially in H&N tumour and oesophageal cancer patients undergoing definite chemoradiotherapy. A gastropexy push system may be considered to avoid cancer seeding. Radiologic and surgical gastrostomy are alternatives when an endoscopic approach is not feasible. Postpyloric nutrition is indicated for patients intolerant to gastric feeding and may be achieved through nasoenteric tubes, PEG with jejunal extension, percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy and surgical jejunostomy. Oesophageal and enteric stents are palliative techniques that allow oral feeding and improve quality of life. Surgical or EUS-guided gastrojejunostomy is recommended when enteric stents fail or prolonged survival is expected. Nutritional intervention is dependent on the technique chosen. Institutional protocols and decision algorithms should be developed on a multidisciplinary basis to optimize nutritional care.Gastroenterologists play a central role in the nutritional support of cancer patients performing endoscopic techniques that maintain oral or enteral feeding. The selection of the most effective technique must consider the cancer type, the oncologic therapeutic program, nutritional aims and expected patient survival.O cancro digestivo encontra-se entre as principais causas de morbilidade e mortalidade globais.

Data Sources: The data sources were MEDLINE, PubMed, NEJM, Google Scholar, and Google searches of references from relevant and eligible trials. Review Methods: We screened abstracts and full-text articles of identified references for eligibility and reviewed randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and meta-analysis for evidence on benefits of using NSAIDs in CRC treatments. For all extracted data, completeness and relevance were checked. Results: The risk of any adenoma among frequent NSAID users was 26.8% vs 39.9% among placebo subjects who later used NSAIDs sporadically (adjusted relative risk = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.39-0.98; P trend with NSAID use frequency = .03). Long-term use of aspirin reduces the risk of CRC. Aspirin also reduces the incidence of colon adenomas and mortality, especially when used for >10 years. Rofecoxib is associated with the reduction of CRC; however, it was associated with cardiovascular risk (with an overall unadjusted relative risk of 1.50 [95% CI = 0.76-2.94; P = .24]). Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib trial shows that, for patients of all genotypes, the estimated cumulative incidence of one or more adenomas by year 3 was 59.8% for those randomized to placebo as compared with 43.3% for those randomized to low-dose (200 mg, twice daily) celecoxib (relative risk [RR] = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.59-0.79; P < .001) and 36.8% for those randomized to high-dose (400 mg, twice daily) celecoxib and 60.7% in placebo group (RR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.46-0.64; P < .001). Conclusions: The use of COX-2 inhibitors both prior to and after diagnosis of CRC seemed to be mildly associated with the reduction in mortality of patients with CRC.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of\u00a0Paramyxoviridae\u00a0that elicits considerable interest as an anticancer agent because it can replicate up to 10\u00a0000 times faster in human cancer cells than in most normal cancer cells. Several NDV strains reportedly induce the cytolysis of cancerous cell lines. The attenuated Iraqi strain (AMHA1) of NDV is a novel oncolytic agent with promising antitumor characteristics, including apoptosis induction. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the AMHA1 NDV strain to induce apoptotic cell death in hematological tumors through caspase-dependent or independent apoptotic pathways. The cytolytic effects of AMHA1 NDV strains of different multiplicity of infection (MOIs) (20, 15,10, 5, 3, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 )and exposure for all hematological malignancy cell lines (human non-Hodgkin lymphoma SR and human multiple myeloma (COLO 677) and human monocytic leukemia THP1) have been determined through a microtetrazolium (MTT) assay. Propidium iodide and acridine orange (AO/PI) double staining were used to examine the ability of attenuated NDV strain to induce apoptosis in infected cells under a fluorescence microscope and to quantify the percentage of apoptosis induction. Quantitative immunocytochemistry assay was further used to study the caspase-dependent and independent protein expression levels in infected and control cells. Cells treated with NDV strains showed a higher cell-death percentage than untreated cells as quantified by the MTT assay. AO/PI results revealed that NDV exerted a powerful and significant effect on apoptosis induction (P<0.0001) in the human cancer cell lines tested in comparison with control cells. Immunocytochemistry in AMHA1 NDV- infected\u00a0human\u00a0hematological cell lines revealed a remarkable increase in the expression of caspase 8, 9 (dependent pathway), apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G (independent pathway) in comparison with untreated cells.

Therefore the question arises whether different techniques used to remove skin lesions may impact the formation and quality of skin scars.To perform an evaluation of skin scars formed by laser and surgical incisions and their influence on lymphatic outflow in rats.Five male rats were used. Using methylene blue, the migration of dye through lymphatic channels of the lower extremity was measured. Afterwards, transverse incisions were made distally using laser and a surgical blade. Wounds were left to heal by secondary intention. After 4 weeks dye migration assessment was repeated and tissue samples were obtained for microscopic evaluation.Wounds after surgical incisions healed entirely. Wounds after laser treatment had not healed, with a visible area of granulation tissue and hair loss. Significantly worse dye migration was observed in rat extremities after laser therapy than after surgical incision (p = 0.007).The results of the study show that the size of the scar can depend on the incision technique used.

Statistics were performed on SPSS software (version 20.0).There were 94 patients with adnexal masses included in the study, 65 (69.1%) had epithelial ovarian cancer and 29 (30.9%) were diagnosed benign on histopathology. In both pre- and postmenopausal patients, ROMA values were significantly higher in patients with malignancy compared to those with benign disease (p\u2009<\u20090.05). ROMA score was of a significant diagnostic value in both premenopausal (AUC\u2009=\u20090.914, Z\u2009=\u200910.81, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and postmenopausal patients (AUC\u2009=\u20090.975, Z\u2009=\u200921.51, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In premenopausal females, ROMA\u2009>\u200913.3% was able to discriminate malignant from benign patients with 97.06% sensitivity and 85.00% specificity. The positive and negative predictive values were 91.7% and 94.4%.

It is known that breast cancer cells in proximity to macrophages become more invasive in an Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) dependent manner. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are thin, F-actin containing, cellular protrusions that mediate intercellular communication and have been identified in many tumors. The mechanism of TNT formation varies between different cell types. M-Sec (TNFAIP2) has been demonstrated to be involved in TNT formation in some cell types including macrophages. Yet, the requirement of M-Sec in tumor cell TNT formation in response to macrophages has not been explored.The aim of this study was to determine whether EGF was required for macrophage induced tumor cell TNTs in an M-Sec dependent manner and what possible roles tumor cell TNTs play in tumor cell migration and invasion.Macrophage Conditioned Media (CM) was used to induce an increase in TNTs in a number of breast cancer cell lines as measured by live cell microscopy. Tumor cell TNT formation by CM was dependent on the presence of EGF which was sufficient to induce TNT formation. CM treatment enhanced the level of M-Sec identified using western blot analysis. Reduction of endogenous M-Sec levels via shRNA in MTLn3 mammary adenocarcinoma cells inhibited the formation of TNTs. The role of tumor cell TNTs in cell behavior was tested using in vitro transwell and 3D invasion assays. No effect on chemotaxis was detected but 3D invasion was reduced following the knockdown of M-Sec in tumor cell TNTs.Our results show that EGF was necessary and sufficient for tumor cell TNT formation which was dependent on cellular M-Sec levels.

The research was based within 5 breast imaging registries in the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Using a structured interview guide we conducted 6 focus groups with 41 women who had a personal history of breast cancer. We conducted a systematic literature review, following all relevant standards. We identified 33 938 surveillance mammograms and 2506 breast MRIs from 13 266 women following treatment for stage 0 to III breast cancer diagnosed in 2003-2012; second cancer events were ascertained within 1 year after imaging. We estimated performance measures using end-of-day radiologic assessment and compared them using multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders.

Unadjusted performance measures comparing breast MRI to mammography only (respectively, per 1000 examinations), were cancer detection rates (within 1 year of exam): 10.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-12.0) vs 8.2 (95% CI, 7.98.5); and interval cancer rates: 6.8 (95% CI, 5.8-7.8) vs 3.5 (95% CI, 3.3-3.7).

Doxorubicin (DOX) is used as a first-line treatment for osteosarcoma; however, the tumour recurrence rate remains high. Recent studies have suggested that DOX-induced migration and stemness in osteosarcoma cells might be the primary reason of recurrence and drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, it is urgent to explore novel effective treatments to overcome DOX-induced drug resistance of osteosarcoma.Osteosarcoma cells KHOS and U2OS were treated with DOX and apatinib (AP) alone or in combination. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony formation assays were performed to evaluate effects on proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out to assess cell apoptosis. Cell migration was determined by the transwell assay. Cancer stemness was detected by flow cytometry analysis of CD133+ cells and sphere-formation assay. Western blot assay was used to measure the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/p-STAT3, SRY-box2 (Sox2) and octamer-binding protein 4 (Oct4), and Nanog in treated osteosarcoma cells.Herein, we revealed that AP treatment significantly enhanced the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to DOX, reversed the DOX-induced stemness phenotype and metastasis capacity of osteosarcoma cells, and abolished the upregulation of p-STAT3, Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog. We further demonstrated that AP reversed DOX-induced stemness and migration of osteosarcoma cells through Sox2.These results suggested that AP significantly abolished the DOX-induced stemness phenotype and metastasis capacity in osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting Sox2 via STAT3 signalling.Our study indicates that Doxorubicin-based chemotherapeutics may simulate cancer stem cells (CSCs) properties in osteosarcoma, leading to the resistance of osteosarcoma.

In this work, we consider a more general class of nonparametric distributions as the prior on the divisor terms, namely the class of normalized completely random measures (NormCRMs). To improve the effectiveness of the clustering, we propose modeling the dependence among the divisors through a nonparametric hierarchical structure, which allows for the sharing of parameters across the samples in the data set. This desirable feature enables us to cluster together different components of multivariate data in a parsimonious way. We demonstrate through simulations that this approach provides accurate graphical model inference, and apply it to a case study examining the dependence structure in radiomics data derived from The Cancer Imaging Atlas.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32431779": {"ArticleTitle": "High-Dimensional Confounding Adjustment Using Continuous Spike and Slab Priors.", "AbstractText": "In observational studies, estimation of a causal effect of a treatment on an outcome relies on proper adjustment for confounding. If the number of the potential confounders (p) is larger than the number of observations (n), then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects. Under standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable X is strongly associated with the treatment T but weakly with the outcome Y, the coefficient \u03b2 will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding bias. Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients \u03b2 corresponding to the potential confounders X . Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the coefficients (\u03b2 s) of the X s that are strongly associated with T but weakly associated with Y. We compare our proposed approach to several state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables; and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes.

First, work loss is associated with greater intention to quit and more likelihood of smoking cessation, and this relationship is moderated by a decrease in income. Second, work loss is associated with lower quit intention and lower rates of smoking cessation, and this relationship is moderated by an increase in psychological distress.We used pooled data from three countries participating in the ITC Project: France, Germany and the Netherlands (n=2712). We measured unemployment, income and psychological distress at two consecutive survey waves, and calculated changes between survey waves. We first conducted multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the association between work loss and smoking cessation behavior. Next, we added income decrease and psychological distress increase to the models. Finally, we added interaction terms of work loss by income decrease and work loss by distress increase to the model.Work loss was not associated with quit intention, quit attempts, and quit success. When income decrease and psychological distress increase were added to the model, we found a positive association between distress increase and quit attempts. The interactions, however, were not statistically significant.Our results indicate that smokers who become unemployed and face a decrease in income are not less likely to quit smoking than smokers who are employed.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32411898": {"ArticleTitle": "Denormalising tobacco at a Danish music festival.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": []}, "32411897": {"ArticleTitle": "Association of smokeless tobacco with oral cancer: A review of systematic reviews.", "AbstractText": "Various primary studies and systematic reviews have been conducted to explain the association between smokeless tobacco and oral cancer.

Antiestrogens tamoxifen (TAM) and fulvestrant (FUL) are effective for treatment of ESR1-positive breast tumors, but development of resistance represents a major clinical challenge. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these events remain largely unknown. Here, we report that 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), TAM, and FUL stabilize MORC2 (MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2), an emerging oncoprotein in human cancer, in a GPER1-dependent manner. Mechanistically, GPER1 activates PRKACA (protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha), which in turn phosphorylates MORC2 at threonine 582 (T582). Phosphorylated MORC2 decreases its interaction with HSPA8 (heat shock protein family A [Hsp70] member 8) and LAMP2A (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A), two core components of the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) machinery, thus protecting MORC2 from lysosomal degradation by CMA. Functionally, knockdown of MORC2 attenuates E2-induced cell proliferation and enhances cellular sensitivity to TAM and FUL. Moreover, introduction of wild-type MORC2, but not its phosphorylation-lacking mutant (T582A), in MORC2-depleted cells restores resistance to antiestrogens. Clinically, the phosphorylation levels of MORC2 at T582 are elevated in breast tumors from patients undergoing recurrence after TAM treatment. Together, these findings delineate a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for MORC2 stabilization in response to estrogen and antiestrogens via blocking CMA-mediated lysosomal degradation and uncover a dual role for MORC2 in both estrogen-induced proliferation and resistance to antiestrogen therapies of breast cancer cells.4-OHT: 4-hydroxytamoxifen; Baf A1: bafilomycin A1; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; E2: 17\u03b2-estradiol; ESR: estrogen receptor; FUL: fulvestrant; GPER1: G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1; HSPA8: heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8; LAMP2A: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A; MORC2: MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2; PRKACA: protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha; TAM: tamoxifen; VCL: vinculin.", "query": "Cancer", "mesh": ["Autophagy", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Chymases", "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Catalytic Subunits", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Estradiol", "Estrogen Receptor Modulators", "Estrogens", "Female", "Fulvestrant", "HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2", "Lysosomes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Stability", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Signal Transduction", "Tamoxifen", "Transcription Factors"]}, "32399490": {"ArticleTitle": "Diffuse Leiomyomatosis: Complete Myomectomy for Innumerable Small Nodules to Achieve Fertility Sparing and Childbearing.", "AbstractText": "Diffuse leiomyomatosis is a rare condition among benign smooth muscle neoplasms of the uterus, being defined as innumerable small myomatous nodules that mainly occur in the submucosal area.

This technique exposes tumor tissue to extreme cold temperatures, effectively destroying tumor cells by irreversibly compromising their plasma membranes.

# Examine the contents of hw2-patients.xml  Download hw2-patients.xml in a text-editor to see its structure, 
# but in brief, there are a handful of fields you can ignore for this exercise and then several <patient> entries, 
# all contained inside <patients>. Each <patient> has several attributes that we will want, namely name, age, and gender. 
# Some patients have other associated data (e.g. diagnoses), but we won't need that here.


# Load the data. 
# Do any of the patients share the same exact age? (2 points) How do you know? (2 points).

# Identifying the oldest person from a list sorted by age should be an O(1) task... 
# but sorting is an O(n log n) process (assuming we're using an efficient algorithm), 
# so the total time for the above is O(n log n). Describe how (you don't need to implement this, 
# unless that's easier than writing it out) you could find the second oldest person's name in O(n) time. (2 points).


# First I can use find max function to find the oldest patient's age. 
# Then I could loop through the entire list to find which patient's age is the largest after removing the oldest one. Thus it is O(n) time.

# Discuss when it might be advantageous to sort and when it is better to just use the O(n) solution. (2 points).


# It might be advantageous to sort the list when I want to quickly return the value and when the number of items in the list is relatively large (n is large).
# It is better to just use the O(n) solution when I do not want to change the orginal list and when n is small. 

# Recall from our discussion of the motivating problem for September 9th that we can search within a sorted list in O(log n) time via bisection. 
# Use bisection on your sorted list (implement this yourself; don't trivialize the problem by using Python's bisect module) to identify the patient who is 41.5 years old. (2 points)
